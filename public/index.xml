&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many children with congenital disabilities in rural Mexico, Juan Antonio – or &amp;ldquo;Tonio&amp;rdquo; for short – was given to and raised by his grandparents, who live in a small village called Tablón #2, south of Mazatlan. From around three years old, Tonio began to show signs of increasing physical weakness, especially in his legs. He tripped and fell frequently, and had increasing difficulty getting up off the floor, and climbing steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unusual weakness was especially troublesome at the home of his grandparents, which is perched on a steep hillside overlooking the village. And it became an even bigger problem when Tonio started school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tiny one-room schoolhouse is located on a facing hillside, and has two sets of stairs, one with 8 steps, the other with 4. The steps are steep, of irregular height and depth, and are without handrails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his first years of schooling, Tonio could climb these steps by himself, be it with difficulty and occasional falls. But now, at age nine and in the 5th grade, to go up these steps safely he needed help – for which he feels ashamed to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/01-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;The first, lower set of steps to reach the schoolhouse&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the small village school has only 11 pupils &amp;ndash; from 1st to the 5th grade &amp;ndash; and a single teacher, who instructs them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his first three or four years at school, Tonio was miserable. Some of the older children teased him for the odd way he walked, and called him a wimp. Tonio became very withdrawn. He would sit by himself in the far corner of the classroom and was too shy to speak. The teacher scolded him for not participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in his 5th year, things had become somewhat better. The new teacher, a young man named Alfonso, has done his best to include Tonio and to encourage his classmates to befriend him. But, by now, Tonio had become so timid and withdrawn that there was almost no interaction between him and the other children. The teacher, over time, gradually won the boy&amp;rsquo;s trust to the point where Tonio sometimes spoke to him when they were alone. But when other children were present, he rarely said anything beyond a muffled &amp;ldquo;Si&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; Regardless of what is going on around him, his face always had the same, quiet, far-off look that made it difficult to read his emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/02-010.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Teacher, Mario Alfonzo, encourages Tonio to take part in activities with the other children&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recess brought another problem. Despite the teacher encouraging him to go out and play with the others, Tonio would sit placidly at his desk, reading his schoolbooks. Once again, the sets of stairs were an obstacle; they separated the schoolhouse from the spacious playground, which is located on a lower level. At recess, the flock of children would dash out of the school and bound down the steps to the playground &amp;ndash; leaving Tonio behind. And even when the teacher would shepherd him outside and help him down both flight of steps, the boy would just stand at the edge of the playground, silently watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;meeting-tonio:73e259bca592158b78ac6a2e1aa2ff06&#34;&gt;Meeting Tonio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first learned of Tonio several months ago from my close friend, Polo Ribota, who since childhood has been deeply involved in our community-based rehabilitation efforts. In my old age, Polo and his family have built a house for me next to theirs in the village of Tablón Viejo, just down the road from Tablón #2. Polo, who is a friend of Tonio&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, told me that Tonio, &amp;ldquo;has trouble walking,&amp;rdquo; and took me there to see what advice I might have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/03-010.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;To get up from the ground or climb steps, a child with muscular dystrophy will often push on his weak thighs or knees to add force.&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonio&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis of Duchene&amp;rsquo;s Muscular Dystrophy had been made a couple of years before by a pediatrician in Mazatlán. Although there was no known family history, the boy´s progressive weakness, his characteristic gait, his hypertrophied (oversized) yet weak calf muscles, and the way he pushed down on his weak thighs with his hands to stand up or climb stairs,  led me to believe the diagnosis was correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;callout box left &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View &lt;a href=&#34;http://hesperian.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en_dvc_2009/en_dvc_2009_10.pdf&#34;&gt;Chapter 10 on Muscular Dystrophy&lt;/a&gt; from David Werner&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Disabled Village Children&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://hesperian.org/books-and-resources/?book=download_disabled_village_children#tabs-downloads&#34;&gt;[Table of Contents]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the medical diagnosis had been made by doctors, and a muscle biopsy had been performed to confirm it, no one had explained to the family what muscular dystrophy is or what to expect – except that the weakness would gradually increase, and that there is no known medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my best to explain the disability to the grandparents. I emphasized that although the condition is progressive and life expectancy is short, there was a lot that could be done to help the boy live as happy and fulfilling a life as possible, despite his increasing physical limitations. I pointed out that Tonio has a good mind, and should be given every opportunity to develop and use it. Effort should be made to have him stay in school, and to make schooling a positive and enabling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did my best to talk to Tonio, to and try to win his trust. But I soon realized this would not be easy. The boy just looked at me with big wondering eyes, never saying a word. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s how he is with everyone,&amp;rdquo; said his grandmother, &amp;ldquo;except with us … and only when we&amp;rsquo;re inside the house alone. Then he&amp;rsquo;ll chatter away – but he almost never mentions his worries or himself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His grandparents were concerned that, on the hillside where they lived, the series of crude steps to get up to and into the house made coming and going an ordeal for the boy. And the problem was getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encouraged Tonio&amp;rsquo;s grandfather to consider building ramps, with railings, and gave him some pointers. The next time I came to visit (several weeks later, as I had been traveling), I was delighted to see the ramps in place and Tonio successfully using them. As the boy showed me how he used them, as ever, he made no comment. But the hint of a smile as he went up and down the main ramp, holding onto the wooden railings, revealed a glimmer of pride in his improved self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right small&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/03-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Walking up ramp helps stretch his tight heel-cords, which may allow the boy to keep walking longer.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main ramp, while steeper than typically recommended, serves three purposes quite well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides easier, safer accessibility for the boy, allowing independent entry to his home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It supplies good exercise for his weakened thigh muscles: neither too much no too little for his current dystrophic state. (Too strenuous exercise can increase muscle loss.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stretches his tight heel-cords by bending his feet upwards as he climbs the ramp. This important stretching exercise helps prevent the Achilles tendon contractures common in muscular dystrophy. (With such contractures the child has to walk on tiptoes, which causes greater instability and earlier loss of ability to walk at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;physical-disability-as-generator-of-emotional-handicap:73e259bca592158b78ac6a2e1aa2ff06&#34;&gt;Physical disability as generator of emotional handicap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonio&amp;rsquo;s greatest asset is his brain. The boy is intelligent and has a curious mind. He likes to read, especially about dinosaurs and astronomy. Perhaps his being a &amp;ldquo;book worm&amp;rdquo; stems from his physical limitations. But, for whatever the reason, his reading level is advanced for his age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonio still has mixed feelings about school. He likes the stories in the books. And, little by little, he has come to like – and in private, even speak to – his current teacher. But, for Tonio, school also has its distressing downsides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: getting to school is an ordeal. The most direct route from home is over a rough footpath that is quite steep in places. Though only a 10 minute walk, he can no longer do it by himself. Every morning his grandmother walks with him to school, providing necessary support. On arrival, she helps him up the two flights of steps in front of the school, and then she walks back home. At noon, when the children go home for a lunch break, she walks again to the school to escort Tonio back home. Although the other pupils return for the afternoon session, Tonio does not. The hot afternoon walks are too exhausting, both for him and for his grandmother. To make up for what he misses in the afternoon lessons, the teacher assigns him extra homework – which Tonio, like most schoolboys, hates – especially the math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: at school Tonio is very much a loner. The big bullies from earlier years are now gone and the present children are basically amiable. The teacher encourages them to befriend and include the isolated boy. But Tonio is so withdrawn and silent that the other kids tend to give up on their efforts, and just ignore him. In some ways, Tonio&amp;rsquo;s emotional isolation and paralyzing sense of shame have become a greater handicap than his physical disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third: the physical barriers at the school add to the above problems. The precarious flights of steps, which also separate the schoolhouse from the playground, isolate him even more. Ashamed to ask for help in coping with the steps, he sequesters himself in the classroom while his peers romp together in the playground. So it is that the physical, social and psychological barriers amplify one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;child-to-child-activities-to-the-rescue:73e259bca592158b78ac6a2e1aa2ff06&#34;&gt;Child-to-Child activities to the rescue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing Tonio&amp;rsquo;s situation with his teacher and grandparents – and as best we could with the boy himself – we decided to facilitate &amp;ldquo;Child-to-Child&amp;rdquo; activities in the classroom and playground. Our goals were to sensitize his classmates to Tonio&amp;rsquo;s needs and possibilities, to explore ways to include him more fully and to make school more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning Polo&amp;rsquo;s wife Felipa and I went to the school in Tablón #2 and met with the children. We started with a slide show showing Child-to-Child activities in other schools, ranging from Nicaragua to Michoacan, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately &amp;ndash; as part of a national attempt to modernize education &amp;ndash; the little school in Tablón #2 was equipped with a fancy computer linked to an overhead projector. Unfortunately, neither worked. Luckily, as a backup I&amp;rsquo;d brought my laptop. Its small screen was no problem; the 11 pupils happily crowded around it, and viewed the presentation at close range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of the slide show was the true &amp;ldquo;foto-historia&amp;rdquo; of Jesus, a partially blind boy with spina-bifida. At age 10, Jesus had just started school for the first time. This was in the village of Ajoya, where at that time PROJIMO (Program of Rehabilitation Organized by Disabled Youth of Western Mexico) was located. Though Jesus had begun school eagerly, he soon grew discouraged because other students teased him and the teacher scolded him for not being able to read the blackboard. Fortunately, however, this situation was greatly improved with the help of Ramona, a disabled young woman visiting from Nicaragua, who facilitated a Child-to-Child activity in Jesus&amp;rsquo;s classroom. To sensitize the children, Ramona had them play games simulating different disabilities, and then discuss what it felt like to be made fun of or left behind. Next, she asked the children think of ways they could help Jesus participate more fully, both in their studies and their games, despite his physical and visual handicaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/04-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Simulation games such as covering the eyes to cause &amp;#39;blindness&amp;#39; can help children get a brief taste of disability.

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These eye-opening activities were so transformative for both the students and their teacher that they became much more understanding and inclusive of Jesus. Likewise for Jesus, the experience was so motivating that, as a part of PROJIMO&amp;rsquo;s community outreach program, he eventually became a Child-to-Child facilitator himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then showed slides of the first such Child-to-Child event that Jesus helped to lead. In the village of Limon, two brothers with muscular dystrophy had been teased so cruelly by their classmates that they refused to go to school anymore. To remedy this, Jesus, among other activities, involved the school children in helping make therapeutic playground devices in the two brothers&amp;rsquo; backyard. The social dynamics improved so much that the brothers, when coaxed to give school a second try, were eagerly welcomed by their classmates. In this way, children learn to derive satisfaction by looking for ways to include and help, rather than exclude or torment, the child who is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/04-040.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Carrying his crutches, they help him down the steep slope to the river, where Pedrito  with his arms strong from crutch use can swim as well or better than the others.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of the activity with the schoolchildren in Tablón #2, we also showed slides where children in another village put on a brief skit. The skit had two scenes. In the first, a group of kids on a hot summer day run excitedly toward the river to swim, leaving Pedrito, a youngster on crutches, unhappily behind. In the second scene, the same group of kids invites Pedrito to go with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this skit, we asked the children if it gave them any ideas regarding Tonio. They said they wanted to be sure to include him more in their activities and games. Hearing this Antonio blushed – and almost smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the slide presentation and some spirited discussion, Tonio&amp;rsquo;s classmates were eager to play some simulation games. To this end, they all sprang to their feet and dashed out the door and down the steps toward the playground – ironically leaving Tonio behind. As usual, Tonio remained mutely in his chair, with his vacant look of quiet resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, something happened! Half way down the steps, a small girl stopped and cried out, &amp;ldquo;What about Tonio?&amp;rdquo; Then they all stopped, turned around, and rushing back into the classroom, asked Tonio to join them. At first Tonio refused. Then he silently rose to his feet. The other children scrambled around him like ants around honey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/05-010.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;On reaching the stairs, they jostled to see who would help him down the steps.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonio silently accepted all this attention, but behind his overt expression of embarrassment was a glimmer of approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the playground, the children took turns simulating a physical disability. Everyone wanted to play the disabled child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/06-010.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;In the simulation games the children took turns having a stick tied to their leg to give them a limp.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/06-050.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;After several such races, all the children  including Tonio  formed a circle, holding hands.&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After several such races, all the children  including Tonio  formed a circle, holding hands.



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, Tonio stayed on the sidelines. To include him, they tried to make him referee, by having him say, &amp;ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&amp;rdquo; But Tonio wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open his mouth. So they asked him to hold up his arm and lower it as the signal &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; Little by little, Tonio accepted this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four children who had raced with a simulated disability stood in the middle of the circle. They were asked questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does it fell like to be left behind?&amp;rdquo; … &amp;ldquo;or to be laughed at when you stumble or can&amp;rsquo;t keep up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all the children were asked, &amp;ldquo;What are some games you can play in which a child with a lame leg, or who can&amp;rsquo;t run, can take part just as well as the rest of the children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the schoolkids suggested games such as &amp;ldquo;marbles&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;jacks&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pick up sticks.&amp;rdquo; But most of the children suggested active group games they already played on the playground. Some were the equivalent, or variations of, &amp;ldquo;musical chairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schoolteacher suggested they actually play some of these games, making a point to include Tonio. So they did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;identifying-and-overcoming-barriers:73e259bca592158b78ac6a2e1aa2ff06&#34;&gt;Identifying and overcoming barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part the activities with Tonio&amp;rsquo;s class, we asked the children what they thought some of the problems or obstacles might be that make it difficult for Tonio to take part fully and happily in school. The children identified the following difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting from his home to the school is hard. The trail is steep and rough. Tonio&amp;rsquo;s grandmother has to walk with him and provide support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this reason, Tonio goes to school only in the mornings. It&amp;rsquo;s too tiring, both for him and his grandmother, to also come in the afternoon, when it is often brutally hot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get into the schoolhouse, the two steep flights of steps are a major barrier  and hazard  especially since there are no railings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steps are also a big obstacle to Tonio&amp;rsquo;s participation on the playground during recess. Tonio can&amp;rsquo;t manage the steps safely alone and is embarrassed to ask for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What actions might we take to overcome these difficulties?&amp;rdquo; we asked the children. They had a lot of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One girl suggested that families who had cars could take turns driving Tonio to and from school every day. The teacher pointed out that while this was a good idea, it was probably too idealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boy suggested, &amp;ldquo;At least we could help level out the rough areas of the trail.&amp;rdquo; Everyone thought that was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the steep flights of steps to get to the school, some children suggested putting up railings. Others thought it would be better building ramps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed these various alternatives with the children and the teacher, and as best we could with Tonio, whose shy responses were limited to a muffled &amp;ldquo;Si&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into consideration the boy&amp;rsquo;s physical condition, the anticipated course of his muscular dystrophy, and his therapeutic needs, we finally came up with a plan of action and assistive equipment, which included the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-spider-like-wheelchair-carriage:73e259bca592158b78ac6a2e1aa2ff06&#34;&gt;A Spider-like Wheelchair Carriage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/08-010.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Side view of a possible design for Tonio&amp;#39;s wheeled carriage&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for getting from home to school, as long as Tonio was still able to walk reasonably well, it made sense for his grandmother to keep walking with him to school every day. This moderate amount of exercise would help keep his muscles as strong as possible, despite their gradual deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, since Tonio and his grandmother only had stamina to walk to and from school in mornings, in order that Tonio to be able to attend the afternoon session, some kind of transport was needed. Perhaps a wheelchair. But on the steep, rough trail between his house and school, a standard wheelchair would be useless – and dangerous! And even it were specially adapted, who would push it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/08-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Overhead view&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these questions in mind, I drew the following sketch of a &amp;ldquo;wheelchair cart,&amp;rdquo; adapted both for difficult terrain, and for the possibility of being pushed/pulled by a group of 4 or more small children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sturdy design has extra-large, widely spaced caster wheels in front, and broad mountain-bike tires. It also has four long, spider-like extension &amp;ldquo;arms&amp;rdquo; so that several children can handily push and pull it from both front and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed the drawings to Tonio and his classmates and asked them, if such a child-drawn carriage were made, would they be willing to transport Tonio daily to and from his home to the school, so he could attend the afternoon session. The class unanimously cried, &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked Tonio if he liked the idea, and after a moment&amp;rsquo;s hesitation nodded yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was apparent, however, that Tonio had mixed feelings about the device. And the teacher, who had got to know Tonio&amp;rsquo;s grandparents fairly well, felt they too might have reservations about providing their grandson with a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This we could understand. For persons who have progressive weakness or increasing difficulty walking, it is often difficult for them – and their loved ones – to accept a wheelchair. To do so is somehow to &amp;ldquo;give up hope.&amp;rdquo; To them, being &amp;ldquo;confined&amp;rdquo; to a wheelchair means resigning oneself to being &amp;ldquo;invalid&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;cripple,&amp;rdquo; which they equate with being useless, helpless, unattractive, lacking value, and unable to lead a rewarding, productive life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/08-030.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;The children and their teacher helped take the basic measurements for Tonio&amp;#39;s child-drawn carriage.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such negative conceptions about disability are very common, and not easy to change. But it is crucial to get beyond them, to recognize that even people with profound disability can often lead fulfilling and happy lives. Getting to know disabled persons who are doing just that is important for someone struggling to accept their disability. For this reason, in my slide show for Tonio and his classmates, I included photos of wheelchair users who devote their lives to designing and creating customized wheelchairs for disabled children. I told the children that Tonio&amp;rsquo;s unique &amp;ldquo;child-drawn carriage&amp;rdquo; would be made by a team of wheelchair riders in PROJIMO Duranguito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/09-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Raymundo, in the PROJIMO Duranguito workshop, working on the wheelchair carriage for Tonio.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the &amp;ldquo;all-terrain spider carriage,&amp;rdquo; as it became known, was made. Raymundo, a paraplegic, wheelchair-using leader of the Duranguito team, took personal responsibility for the construction of the carriage. It was completed and beautifully painted within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we took the carriage to the school, everyone was excited about it – with the exception, perhaps, of Tonio. All the children wanted to try it, both as riders and pushers. We let them test it out before Tonio tried it, and their overflowing enthusiasm with the strange carriage was what I think proved contagious for Tonio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had worried that Tonio might refuse to use the strange device. But when his turn came, he willingly got into the carriage and let the other children push/pull him around the spacious playground, trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;threeup &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/10-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;All the children were eager to try out riding and pushing Tonio&amp;#39;s new spider-mobile.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;threeup &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/10-040.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Tonio sat in his carriage and let his classmates wheel him around the playground.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was time for the real test run: &lt;em&gt;from the school to his house.&lt;/em&gt; Tonio&amp;rsquo;s grandmother had come to accompany the expedition. The schoolteacher, a bit nervously, also joined the brigade. All Tonio&amp;rsquo;s classmates were chafing at the bit to help transport him in the spider-mobile. And with its long arms projecting fore and aft, as many as 7 or 8 youngsters could all push and pull it at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/10-050.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;The first part of the foray went smoothly, because it was over a fairly level dirt road.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/10-060.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Even on the rougher and steeper sections of the trail, the children navigated the spider-carriage with ease and good control.&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone&amp;rsquo;s delight, when we reached the irregular trails with sand, loose rocks and steep ups and downs, the group of children effortlessly navigated the strange vehicle in a surprisingly smooth ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached his house and Tonio dismounted, we asked him if he liked his new spider carriage. With the biggest smile I had yet seen him give, he replied an emphatic, &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little by little, his grandparents – who at first had serious reservations about their grandson using a wheelchair – have become more comfortable with the idea, and they are pleased to see him interacting more with the other children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left medium&#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/10-070.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Perhaps the best thing about the spider-mobile is that it has helped bring Tonio and his classmates together in a shared, fun, and adventurous way.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus it seems this strange &amp;ldquo;daddy-long legs&amp;rdquo; mobility device has accomplished several objectives at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has provided the means for Tonio to attend the full day of school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has provided an adventurous way for him and his classmates to interact more fully and joyfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has helped both Tonio and his grandparents begin to accept the intermittent use of a wheelchair, which, as his muscular weakness progresses, will eventually become his primary means of mobility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more, the boy, along with his classmates, has learned that wheeled mobility can be fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;making-the-school-steps-safer-and-more-accessible:73e259bca592158b78ac6a2e1aa2ff06&#34;&gt;Making the school steps safer and more accessible&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the difficulty in getting to and from home to the school-grounds was, in large part, resolved with the child-drawn carriage, the next physical barriers to deal with were the two steep flights of steps at the schoolhouse. Something needed to be done to make it easier to get into the school, and to get from the schoolhouse to the playground during recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the possibilities we considered was to build ramps. However, a simpler, if more short-term, alternative would be to install railings for the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramps clearly would theoretically provide a more long-term solution. In a few years, with his muscular dystrophy, Tonio&amp;rsquo;s body will become too weak to walk; he will then get around principally in a wheelchair. Stairs will no longer suffice, and ramps will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for the time being, Tonio can still walk. Be it with difficulty, he can still go up steps by pushing on his weak thighs to provide additional force. But the steep steps ascending to the school, without handrails, are too difficult – and too risky – for him to climb without assistance. And when he has to be assisted he feels ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage of railings over ramps is that they would be quicker, easier, and cheaper to install. Another advantage concerns Tonio&amp;rsquo;s physical capacity. By continuing to climb the steps daily while he can, he would get exercise he needs to keep his weakening body in as strong condition as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will probably be two or three years until Tonio becomes too weak to climb steps, even with a railing. By then he will have graduated from primary school and, hopefully, be attending secondary school in a neighboring town where there is one. So it seemed reasonable to hold off on ramps for the time being, and look to the short-term solution: railings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the necessary materials, Polo bought some old steel pipes cheaply in a scrap metal yard in Mazatlan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/11-010.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;To position the railings and uprights correctly, the schoolchildren helped take the necessary measurements of length, height and angles of the pipes.&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipes were then welded by the disabled workers at PROJIMO Duranguito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install the railings we felt it would be a good idea for the families of the schoolchildren to help do the work. This activity could help get the community more involved in understanding and responding to the needs of those who are more vulnerable. The teacher agreed with this &amp;ldquo;community involvement&amp;rdquo; in principle. But based on his experience, he thought it would be very difficult to gain the participation of adults in Tablón #2. Community spirit was at a low ebb. Poverty was increasing, and many families had moved to what they hoped would be greener pastures. The teacher had a hard time even getting parents to come to meetings about the education and well-being of their own children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/76/600/11-020.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;The children unload the welded pipes for the railings. (The pipes were delivered from Duranguito at the same time as Tonio&amp;#39;s carriage.)&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonio&amp;rsquo;s grandfather had similar doubts, and offered to install the railings for the school steps by himself. However, he agreed that to raise community awareness and cooperation, getting the families involved in installing the railings was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we gave it a shot. The &amp;ldquo;railing-raising&amp;rdquo; date was set on the next Sunday at 4:00 PM, when most fathers would be home from work, and when the heat of the day would be subsiding. Although this was during the Easter holidays and school would be closed, Felipa and I talked to some of the children, who spread the word, like a grapevine. Also, the teacher sent a cell-phone message to all of the parents. But he was still less than optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our delight, the response was fantastic. Although there are only 11 pupils in the school, nearly two dozen parents and relatives showed up – mostly fathers, but also mothers, grandparents, and siblings – as well as some of the schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all these volunteers, the work went rapidly. Several men brought tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;twoup &#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most encouraging things that happened that afternoon while the railings were being installed, was the conviviality that emerged between Tonio and some of the other children present. To escape from the hot sun, Tonio had sat on the curb in the shady eastern side of the schoolhouse. At first he was there alone. But soon some of his classmates and other children – perhaps remembering the lessons on inclusion they&amp;rsquo;d learned in the Child-to-Child activities a few days before – sat down beside him in a friendly way. Before long, they looked like a group of young buddies, sitting together and talking whatever came into their heads. Tonio was actually speaking a few words, and smiling. It was big step forward from the withdrawn, totally silent niche he&amp;rsquo;d occupied just a few days before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to know how things will be for Tonio. Life with muscular dystrophy is not easy. It entails the progressive decline of physical strength, with a loss of one physical ability after another until finally the lung muscles are so weak that breathing is compromised, as is the ability to cough. This often leads to pneumonia, followed by death, usually in the later teens or early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that, some people with muscular dystrophy or other seriously decapacitating or life-shortening disabilities, find ways to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives. In my book, * &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing About Us Without Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00101.htm#contents&#34;&gt;Chapter 48&lt;/a&gt;,I relate a story about four siblings with muscular dystrophy who, even as they grew progressively weaker, were able to have adventurous lives. With their parents they helped to start and lead a program for other disabled children. In the process, they found a satisfaction, a sense of worth, and a degree of joy far beyond that of many people who are essentially normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us hope that Tonio continues to come out of his shell, to interact more confidently with his classmates and other people, and to gain the understanding, motivation and skills he needs to lead his life – for however long it lasts – with his fair share of satisfaction, loving relationships, and joy. Hopefully the growing awareness of his classmates, and their efforts to include him and to make his schooling more accessible, will help him on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From village boy to kind eye surgeon</title>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;summary:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year’s-end newsletter tells the story of a farm boy in México who, more than three decades ago, was helped by the local village health program in the Sierra Madre to continue his schooling. Along the way, he became a village health worker, then a doctor, and finally a gifted eye surgeon and professor of ophthalmology. But the best news is he never forgot his roots. He continues to reach out to disadvantaged people in need. Recently we sought his help for a blind child whom other specialists had essentially given up on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;efforts-to-restore-a-blind-boy-s-sight:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;Efforts to Restore a Blind Boy’s Sight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first met Ramon and his parents through Rigoberto (Rigo) Delgado, a quadriplegic rehabilitation worker, who, in April 2013, invited me to visit a weekly &amp;ldquo;educational exchange&amp;rdquo; that he facilitates with disabled children and their families in Culiacán, the state capital of Sinaloa, México. (You can read Rigo’s remarkable story in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://healthwrights.org/content/newsletters/NL68.pdf&#34;&gt;Newsletter #68&lt;/a&gt;.  The day I visited Rigo he asked my advice regarding a nine-year-old boy named Ramon Ayala, who was virtually blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/0-01.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Dr. Alvarez examining Ramon&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huddled between his parents, the little boy looked unhappy and insecure. He wore very thick spectacles that made his eyes look greatly enlarged. His parents explained that their son had been born with congenital cataracts (clouding of the lenses) and also strabismus (cross eyed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;em&gt;Seguro Social&lt;/em&gt; (the government health insurance program) the boy had received three surgeries.  Initially the doctors had planned to insert intraocular lenses into his eyes, with hopes this would give him more or less normal sight. The opaque lenses in his eyes had been removed, but the doctors then told them that the risks were too great for further surgery. Instead, they had fitted him with the external cataract goggles he was now wearing, which left him legally blind. Yet the &amp;ldquo;risks&amp;rdquo; the doctors referred to had never been clearly specified, either to the parents or on the medical record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramon could see only extremely blurred images. At school he was unable to read either the blackboard or his books, and had to feel his way to get around. The powerful &amp;ldquo;coke bottle&amp;rdquo; goggles made him dizzy and nauseous. To make things worse, he was cruelly teased by some of his classmates, who taunted him with nicknames like “Little Owl” or “the Martian.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/1-01.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Ramon Ayala with his owl-like glasses&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you think might be possible for the boy?&amp;rdquo; Rigo asked me. “Social Security here in Sinaloa essentially says nothing more can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that in Seguro Social, the national health insurance program, often costly procedures which are clinically indicated—even potentially lifesaving ones—are not performed, apparently for economic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence I replied, &amp;ldquo;I think we need a second opinion from an independent, completely trustworthy ophthalmologist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first such ophthalmologist who came to my mind was Dr. Miguel Angel Alvarez, whom I have known since he was a village boy. Indeed, his education had been sponsored by the village health program that I helped set up: from secondary school through prep school, all the way through medical school. Not only was Miguel Angel a first rate ophthalmologist, he was a close friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only obstacle was that Dr. Alvarez was based a long way from Culiacán, in Ciudad Obregon in the state of Sonora, where he is a professor at one of the leading training and referral hospitals in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/3-02.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Rigo (in wheelchair) arranged for Dr. Miguel Angel to examine Ramon in Rigo&amp;#39;s sister&amp;#39;s house in Culiacan&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his distant location, that evening I gave Miguel Angel a phone call. When I told him about Ramon, Miguel Angel chuckled and said, &amp;ldquo;Amazing you called just when you did! As chance would have it, this very weekend I will be coming to Culiacán to visit my parents, who are unwell, and I’d be delighted to examine the boy and evaluate what might be done for him. Be sure to have his complete medical history available.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So three days later, with Rigo as intermediator, Dr. Miguel Angel Alvarez did a thorough evaluation of Ramon’s eyes, his medical record, surgeries performed, and the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards he called me to report his conclusions. &amp;ldquo;I think the boy Ramon is an excellent candidate for intraocular transplants,&amp;rdquo; he said.  “There appear to be no contraindications, and with those internal lenses his vision should be enormously improved. If his family can get him to Obregon, I’d be happy to do the procedure myself.” The out of pocket costs, he explained, wound be minimal. Because Ramon’s family has SS (Seguro Social), and since Dr. Alvarez regularly does eye surgery for the branch of SS in Obregon, he felt confident the primary costs of the procedure would be covered. The biggest cost typically not covered by SS would be the intraocular lenses. In México these are quite expensive. But Miguel Angel hoped that, one way or another, coverage for these could be arranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/3-03.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Dr. Alvarez examines Ramon&amp;#39;s eyes, without his glasses...&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was overjoyed by Miguel Angel’s encouraging evaluation and readiness to help. I explained to Ramon’s family that Dr. Alvarez is one of the best eye surgeons in México, and that I trusted him completely. Both Ramon and his parents had their hopes restored. The decision was made to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were still lots of hurdles ahead. Getting everything arranged for the surgery in Obregon took longer than any of us anticipated. As was to be expected, there were complications in the transfer of Seguro Social coverage from one state to the other, in part due to the fact that the branch in Sinaloa had decided against further surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, we also ran into disapproval of the surgery by the charitable foundation in Holland for whom both Rigo and I are mediators. For years, Stichting Liliana Fonds has helped fund the surgical and other rehabilitation needs of disabled children for whom we solicit assistance. So Rigo and I wrote to the foundation’s Latin American coordinator, telling her about Ramon and the prospects for his eye surgery by Dr. Alvarez. We requested the foundation’s help in paying for the cost of the intra-ocular lenses. After considerable delay, the coordinator wrote back saying she had discussed the proposed surgery with her superiors. To our disappointment, their response was that cataracts in children are rare and that surgery might be risky. So they recommended against the proposed transplants, and were unwilling to help cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/3-04.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;...and with them&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
...and with them



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a series of delays and obstacles arose and months passed, I began to fear that for all the good will, the sight-restoring surgery might never take place. However Miguel Angel’s commitment was unshakable. He kept reassuring us that everything would be arranged in due course. He would personally perform the surgery &amp;hellip; and the probability of good results was high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had anyone else said the same with such confidence, I might have had my doubts. But Miguel Angel’s unwavering optimism kept our hopes alive. I’ve known him for 35 years, since his boyhood, and have repeatedly witnessed his tenacity in surmounting obstacles and accomplishing daunting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me backtrack to tell you the highlights of his story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;miguel-angel-s-boyhood-dream:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;Miguel Angel’s Boyhood Dream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a boy Miguel Angel helped his father herd goats in the foothills of the Sierra Madre



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the summer of 1977, a young boy walked into the Piaxtla community health post in the village of Ajoya. He stood quietly near the door, waiting to be noticed. He was a lanky youngster with dark bronze skin and Indian features. His black eyes had a bright, inquisitive, sparkle.  He looked about 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly, I didn’t recognize him, which was unusual since I knew almost all the children in village.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do I know you?&amp;rdquo; I asked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don’t think so,&amp;rdquo; said the boy. “But I know you. My mother brought me into the clinic a few years ago.  I had big pink worms in my poop. You cured me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do you live?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In El Tule.  A couple of kilometers from here. Up the mountainside. Every day for the last six years I’ve hiked down to Ajoya, to go to school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You must be a son of Santiago, the man with the goats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sí señor,&amp;rdquo; he said. “My name’s Miguel Angel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like the famous Greek sculptor,&amp;rdquo; I said.  “What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked me in the eyes, intensely.  &amp;ldquo;Is it true that when a young person wants to go on with school real bad, but his family can’t afford it, the health program helps out?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; I said, “Not usually.  But tell me about yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he’d just graduated from primary school &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;which is as far as schooling goes in the small village of Ajoya&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; at the top of his class. He wanted to go on to secondary school, but the closest high school was in San Ignacio, 23 kilometers away, and his family couldn’t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why are you so eager to continue school,&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shrugged.  &amp;ldquo;I like to know things. I want to do something with my life. Something more than herd goats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you were to go to the high school in San Ignacio, do you have any relatives there you could stay with during the week?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have an aunt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Would she let you live with her?  Maybe if you help out with odd jobs?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don’t know. I barely know her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why don’t you ask her? If she’s willing to put you up and feed you, I think we could find the bit of money it takes to pay for your enrollment, books, and other incidentals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Really?!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed. His face lit up like a sparkler. “I’ll ask her tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning the boy left El Tule before dawn. He half walked, half jogged the 23 kilometers to San Ignacio, asked his aunt, and then hiked back to Ajoya.  It was 9:00 PM when he knocked on my door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He threw has hands skyward.  &amp;ldquo;She says YES!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/4-03.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Miguel Angel Manjarrez (left, age 14) teaches Miguel Angel Alvarez (age 13) how to drill and fill teeth&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was that Miguel Angel began secondary school. The village health team made an agreement with him that, in exchange for assisting with his schooling costs in San Ignacio, on weekends he would come back to Ajoya and help out in the clinic. Miguel Angel filled his part of the bargain in good faith, and, in the process, learned a great deal about community health care. He mastered all sorts of skills: from vaccinating children to building latrines, from weighing babies to counseling mothers about their infants’ growth and nutrition. He learned how to stitch wounds, cast broken limbs, and identify different intestinal parasites with a microscope. From another young village apprentice, he learned how to pull teeth, drill and fill caries, and play the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miguel Angel’s mind was a sponge. He studied my book &lt;em&gt;Where There Is No Doctor&lt;/em&gt; from cover to cover. When people began to ask him for medical advice, he would help them look things up in the book. They appreciated his caring concern and the clear simple way he explained things.  Little by little, the young man became a capable &lt;em&gt;promotor de salud&lt;/em&gt; (health promoter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/2-02.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Miguel Angel as a boy&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye surgery.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most challenging experiences for Miguel Angel at the Ajoya Clinic involved assisting Dr. Rudolf Bock, an ophthalmologist from Palo Alto, California, who came to do eye surgery at the village health center in Ajoya. With so many blind persons in need of sight-restoring surgery, Dr. Bock needed all the dexterous, caring hands he could get. Miguel Angel eagerly pitched in: testing people’s vision, holding the flashlight to illuminate the surgeries, handing the doctor the right instruments when needed, and bandaging the newly operated eyes. The surgeon quickly recognized that Miguel Angel had genuine interest, a keen mind, and remarkable dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little by little he taught the boy increasingly complex skills and gave him more sophisticated responsibilities, such as measuring the intraocular pressure of people’s eyes with a tonometer. On Dr. Bock’s third surgical visit to Ajoya, he enlisted Miguel Angel as his surgical assistant. And on his fourth visit, he taught him to perform some of the simplest surgical procedures, such as the removal of pterygium. Pterygium, called &lt;em&gt;carnosidad&lt;/em&gt; in village Spanish, is a fleshy growth that slowly forms over the surface of the eye, as result of long-term exposure to sunlight and dust. Untreated, it can cover the pupil and cause blindness. In the mountain villages, pterygium is the most common cause of blindness, followed by cataract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was that Miguel Angel, who was already a junior dentist at age 13, became a junior eye surgeon at 15. Thus he had an early start on what was to become his life’s profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;center &#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miguel Angel graduated from the three years of secondary school again at the top of his class. Then he worked for a year in the villager-run &lt;em&gt;Clínica de Ajoya&lt;/em&gt;, increasing his abilities as a &lt;em&gt;promotor de salud&lt;/em&gt;.  A born teacher, he soon became one of the main facilitators in the training courses for new health promoters. Having come from a poor rural background, he had a good understanding of the underlying social, economic and political determinants of poor health. He helped his fellow villagers to analyze these root causes and take collective action to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;village-theater-for-awareness-raising-and-collective-action:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;Village Theater for Awareness-raising and Collective action.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key methods that Miguel Angel used for awareness-raising and collective action was &lt;em&gt;teatro campesino&lt;/em&gt; or farmworkers’ theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One skit he staged with a group of villagers &amp;ndash; and acted in himself &amp;ndash; was called &amp;ldquo;Medicines that Kill.&amp;rdquo; This skit (which is illustrated in our book &lt;em&gt;Helping Health Workers Learn&lt;/em&gt;) shows how unscrupulous doctors and quacks prescribe expensive, unnecessary, and sometimes dangerous medicines to poor people, with the result that families spend their limited food money on inappropriate medications. As result, children may become increasingly undernourished. Their resistance to the “diseases of poverty” is lowered, and they may even die. The skit dramatically shows how overuse and misuse of medicine can be dangerous to your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &amp;ldquo;Medicines that Kill&amp;rdquo; skit Miguel Angel played the role of a health promoter who advises an elderly couple to spend their limited money on nutritious food rather than on sugar-based IV solutions which are promoted as “artificial life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/4-08.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;In `Medicines` that Kill Miguel Angel acted the role of the village health worker&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another underlying social cause of poor health that Miguel Angel became deeply involved in as a teenage health worker was land tenure.  He and his fellow health workers helped to educate and organize landless farmers for their constitutional land rights. They also encouraged them to demand public access to water, as a human right.  Many of these &amp;ldquo;struggles for health&amp;rdquo; involved confrontation with the local power structure, big landholders, and corrupt authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;women-unite-to-overcome-drunkenness:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Women unite to overcome drunkenness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/5-03.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;In the skit WOMEM UNITE TO OVERCOME DRUNKENNESS all actors were women and children, and women played the parts of the men&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miguel Angel’s &amp;ldquo;activism for a healthier community&amp;rdquo; on one occasion led to his being thrown in jail. The community protest he helped organize, and which precipitated his arrest, addressed the health problems and violence that result from the sale and heavy drinking of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excessive drinking in the Sierra Madre has long had a devastating impact on health, both directly and indirectly. Directly, through the personal afflictions, it causes a variety of health problems: from physical and emotional trauma to cirrhosis of the liver. Indirectly, through the malnutrition it causes in children whose fathers spend their limited food money on booze, excessive drinking contributes to health problems in children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the high frequency of violence and deaths resulting from collective drinking, the &lt;em&gt;cantina&lt;/em&gt; (public bar) in Ajoya had been shut down by the municipal government more than a decade before. It remained closed until the early 1970’s, when the son of the &lt;em&gt;president municipal&lt;/em&gt; talked his father into reopening the cantina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
FARM-WORKER THEATER PRESENTS: WOMEN UNITE AGAINST DRUNKENESS



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the reopening of the cantina was celebrated by many of the men, many women were upset. They knew the dangers it would bring, not only of physical and domestic violence, but also of food shortage and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that Miguel Angel played a key role in mobilizing the women to take a stand. He worked with a group of women and children to put on a village theater skit that they titled, &amp;ldquo;Women unite to overcome drunkenness.&amp;rdquo; Not only did the skit dramatize the drastic and sometimes deadly problems resulting from inebriation, it also explored united action that the village women could take to protest and hopefully close down the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this collective action—which the municipal president and his son called rabble rousing—the president sent a squad of police to Ajoya to arrest Miguel Angel and a collaborating school teacher. They were hauled to San Ignacio and thrown in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This triggered the women in Ajoya to take more assertive action. They trooped by truckloads to San Ignacio and marched outside the jail, demanding release of their &amp;ldquo;political prisoners.&amp;rdquo; They waved placards saying, “WE DON’T WANT A CANTINA, WE WANT SOURCES OF WORK.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/75/w640/5-04.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;The women, with their children, protested outside the jail with signs saying HEALTH YES, SALOON NO and WE DON&amp;#39;T WANT A BAR, WE WANT SOURCES OF WORK&#34; /&gt;


 

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstration continued until the prisoners were released. But Miguel Angel refused to leave his cell until he was given a written statement, either naming what crime he had been arrested for, or stating he had been arrested without charge. With the women still clamoring outside, the authorities finally gave him a note stating the latter (released without charge). With this note, Miguel Angel and a group of women traveled to Culiacán, the state capital, and requested an audience with the Governor. The outcome was that the Governor reprimanded the municipal president for abuse of power, and ordered that the &lt;em&gt;cantina&lt;/em&gt; be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the women’s action in Ajoya was picked up by the state newspapers. As a result, women in several other towns up and down the state took similar action to shut down the bars and illegal &amp;ldquo;drinking holes&amp;rdquo; in their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;back-to-school-again:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;Back to school again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Miguel enjoyed his role as a village health promoter, and made a big contribution in many ways, his heart was set on continuing his studies—with the dream of someday becoming a doctor, and, if possible, an eye surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a year with the Piaxtla health program in Ajoya, following his completion of secondary school, arrangements were made for Miguel Angel to study in a &lt;em&gt;Preparatoria&lt;/em&gt; (college prep school). This he did in México City, where an artist friend of ours, Emile Nava, generously gave him free room and board. Again, Miguel Angel graduated at the top of his class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On finishing &lt;em&gt;la Prepa&lt;/em&gt;, Miguel Angel spent another year helping at the Piaxtla Health Program, and then applied to the Sinaloa state medical school in Culiacán. However, many of his fellow villagers were skeptical. Although they appreciated the young man’s abilities and determination, they couldn’t imagine him ever becoming a doctor. To them it seemed utterly impossible that one of them, a lowly &lt;em&gt;campesino&lt;/em&gt;, could do so. Only high class folks from the cities had the smarts to become real, titled &lt;em&gt;médicos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Miguel Angel fooled them all. Not only did he complete the five years of med school at the top of his class, but his fellow students elected him to give the graduation address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the day of the grand ceremony arrived, all the graduating med students showed up dressed in tuxedos and elegant dress. But not Miguel Angel. When he walked on stage to give the graduation address, everyone gasped. The lanky, dark youth was dressed, not like a graduating doctor, but as a &lt;em&gt;campesino&lt;/em&gt; (farmer). He wore &lt;em&gt;pantalones de mezclilla&lt;/em&gt; (jeans), &lt;em&gt;huaraches&lt;/em&gt; (sandals with car-tire soles, a straw &lt;em&gt;sombrero&lt;/em&gt;, and a shirt tied in a knot at the front. He paused before starting to speak. Finally the murmurs quieted down and the perturbed audience just stared. How dare he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miguel Angel didn’t read from his script as he’d planned. Rather he delivered it by heart, in every sense. He challenged his fellow students—and his professors—to work for the people, not the money. He criticized the vast inequalities in México, both in wealth and health. He decried the fact that most doctors work in the affluent urban neighborhoods, rather than in the poor neighborhoods and rural areas where the needs are greatest. He decried the superior attitude of doctors who think they deserve higher earnings and greater respect than the farm-workers who grow their food. &amp;ldquo;Most people can live fairly well without medicines,&amp;rdquo; he pointed out. &amp;ldquo;But no one can live without food!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed how important it is that doctors–for their own good as well as that of others-relate to those they serve as equals and as friends: as persons rather than as &amp;ldquo;patients.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing medical school, graduating doctors are required to spend a year of public service, typically working in a government health center in an under-served neighborhood or village. Miguel Angel requested and was granted to do his national service in Ajoya, where he worked closely with the Piaxtla team of village health workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Miguel Angel finished his year of rural service near Ajoya, he continued to work with the village health program in Ajoya for nearly two years. He was joined by his new wife, Ana Luisa, who had been a fellow student in medical school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the young doctor´s big dream was to specialize in ophthalmology and become an eye surgeon. With his outstanding performance in medical school and excellent recommendations from his professors, he was accepted into the Ophthalmology Department of the Medical School in Guadalajara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, Miguel finished his residency in ophthalmology with flying colors, as the most accomplished trainee in his group. He began to make plans to further specialize in corneal surgery in México City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to his great disappointment he was not admitted. The rejection had nothing to do with his grades or ability, which were outstanding. Rather, he was apparently turned down because of humble origin, his dark skin, and lack of a prestigious pedigree. In México City, the top ophthalmologists belonged to an elite club of upper class high-brows with notably Spanish ancestry. They were not about to accept into their ranks such a lowlife as an &lt;em&gt;indio campesino&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of his academic qualifications. Miguel Angel, together with his professors from Guadalajara, pounded on the regal doors in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then that an ophthalmologist from Palo Alto, California, Dr. Lee Shehinian, came to the rescue. Dr. Shehinian, like Dr. Bock before him, had made several trips to Ajoya to perform free surgery on villagers with eye problems. He had been highly impressed by both the skills and attitude of the adolescent health worker, who had already learned to do simple eye surgery (pterygium removal) under the guidance of Dr. Bock. Lee, in turn, took Miguel Angel under his wing and taught him additional skills. The two became close friends. Indeed it was Lee, himself a specialist in corneal transplants and laser optical corrections, who put the bug in Miguel Angel’s ear to specialize in that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Miguel Angel was turned down from corneal-surgery residency in México City, Dr. Shehinian talked with a colleague in Tucson, Arizona, who was a world renowned corneal surgeon. At first his colleague had misgivings, but as he began to work with Miguel Angel, he soon realized that the youth was exceptional, and took him on as his personal protégé. He taught Miguel Angel the latest procedures for cataract surgery, corneal transplant, and many other state-of-the-art operations. But the legal logistics were a challenge.  Because Miguel Angel wasn&amp;rsquo;t licensed to practice medicine in the United States, his hands-on surgical practice took place in a small eye clinic in Nogales, México, on the Mexican side of the border, only an hour south of Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, Miguel became a practicing full time eye surgeon in the Nogales clinic. After finishing his specialty training, he opened his own small eye clinic in Nogales, where he worked for more than two decades. He also devoted time to training other Mexican ophthalmologists in the advanced surgical methods of cataract and corneal surgery that he’d learned in Tucson. Both his surgical and teaching skills were much acclaimed, and in 2011 he became a tenured professor of ophthalmology and specialized surgeon at the renowned referral hospital in Ciudad Obregon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his high level of skills and recognition, Miguel has retained his commitment to serving the poor. From the time he became an eye surgeon, he began making periodic trips to Ajoya and other villages to examine persons with eye problems. For those who needed surgery, he was often able to do it virtually free of cost at a surgical center in Culiacán.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first persons from Ajoya on whom Miguel Angel operated was blind Ramona, an elderly woman who had been sightless for years due to cataracts. She had wandered from house to house begging for food and a place to stay. Eventually, PROJIMO, the village rehabilitation program that grew out of the Piaxtla health initiative, took her in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miguel Angel removed Ramona’s cataracts and inserted intraocular lenses. For the old woman, her restored vision was like a gift from the gods. Returning to PROJIMO, she was so happy to be able to do something helpful, she would spend all day sweeping. She swept the kitchen, the dormitories, the workshops, and the grounds. As soon as everything was swept, she would start over again. Her constant sweeping dug holes in footpaths. They had to be filled in later and some workers complained. But there was no stopping her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miguel Angel also did a big favor for Jason Weston, then co-director of our small non-profit organization, HealthWrights. HealthWrights operates on a shoestring and most of our help is volunteer. At a surprisingly young age (early 40s), Jason was diagnosed with a cataract in one eye, and there was no way he could afford the high cost of surgical correction in the US. He had no health insurance. So I contacted Miguel Angel in Nogales, who said, &amp;ldquo;Send him down!&amp;rdquo; A few weeks later he removed Jason’s cataract and put in an intra-ocular lens, at a fraction of the cost in the US. The results were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ramon-ayala-s-eye-surgery:7ea161a55510a0e6b57b12ca0f9226b7&#34;&gt;Ramon Ayala’s eye surgery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several weeks went by after the first steps were taken to clear the way for Dr. Miguel Angel Alvarez to operate on Ramon Ayala. Working out the logistics to transfer the Seguro Social health insurance from one state to another proved to be a complex and difficult undertaking. And the lack of support from the Foundation we worked with in the Netherlands created additional economic barriers. But through all these obstacles, Miguel Angel remained calmly confident it would all work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, after a couple of months, the pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place. Not only did Miguel Angel convince the headquarters of the Seguro Social in Obregon to agree to cover the costs of the procedures, he convinced them to cover the cost of the intraocular lenses, something they rarely do. And surprisingly, after further correspondence with Stichting Liliane Fonds, the Dutch foundation agreed to help with the transportation costs to and from Ciudad Obregon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, everything worked out amazingly well. Ramon and his parents were transported to Obregon, a final medical workup was done, and in January 2014 Miguel Angel performed the most modern, minimally invasive procedure to insert an intraocular lens into Ramon’s dominant eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, Miguel Angel sent me an email with the results of the surgery. He said, &amp;ldquo;What a marvelous experience it was, both for me and for Ramon, when I removed the bandage the day after the operation. The kid was literally dancing! He cried out with delight, ‘I can see! I can see EVERYTHING!’ For me this is the reward I most treasure, for all the long years I put into study and training. It is my greatest joy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month later, in February, Miguel Angel operated on Ramon’s other eye. The results were equally successful. Ramon and his parents returned to their home in Culiacán, overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important surgery was complete and Ramon now had good vision. The only procedure remaining to be done was for the strabismus, to align his two eyes in the same direction. Compared to the cataract surgery, this is a relatively simple intervention, and Miguel’s initial recommendation was that an eye surgeon in Culiacán perform the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, things had gone so well so far that I didn’t want to take any chances. In México there are excellent, highly competent surgeons. But there are others who are so incompetent they shouldn’t be allowed to practice. I therefore told Miguel Angel I’d feel happier if he’d do Ramon’s strabismus surgery himself. And he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramon can now look forward in his life with clarity and hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April of 2014, I, David Werner, was asked to visit Chile and Argentina, the two countries that flank the imposing &lt;em&gt;Cordillera de los Andes&lt;/em&gt; in South America&amp;rsquo;s southern cone. The corresponding groups that invited me – of occupational therapists and of community doctors &amp;ndash;represent the more radical, social-change-seeking arm of their respective professions, much in the way that the &amp;ldquo;Theology of Liberation&amp;rdquo; is the socially progressive arm of the Catholic Church. In sum, within their professions they are the mavericks who stand up for the rights of marginalized people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Chile,&lt;/strong&gt; I was invited by the School of Occupational Therapy at the &amp;ldquo;Universidad Mayor&amp;rdquo; in the southern city of Temuco. The staff of the School believes that occupational therapists should function as &amp;ldquo;agents of social change.&amp;rdquo; In addition to helping persons in situations of disability cope with the sometimes brutal realities of the existing social order, with its inequalities and barriers to inclusion, they strive to make society more egalitarian, compassionate, and welcoming of diversity. This focus on human rights and social justice as the overarching goal of OT has been emerging and expanding worldwide, though in some countries more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Africa, a radical OT named Frank Kronenberg, in 2001, edited a groundbreaking book titled &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Occupational Therapy without Borders&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (to which I wrote the preface). I was pleased to learn that the school of OT in the Universidad Mayor uses this book, along with my handbooks, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Disabled Village Children&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing About Us Without Us,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; as basic texts. ** Staff and students there welcomed me as an old friend, and as an ally in the effort to build a healthier more inclusive society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/01a.JPG&#34;alt=&#34;My invitation to Temuco was spearheaded by Eduardo Herrera Osorio, co-director of the School of Occupational Therapy at &amp;#39;Universidad Mayor.&amp;#39; Here, on one of our field trips to visit Community Based Rehabilitation activities among the Mapuche tribal people, a traditional thatched hut, or ruca.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Argentina,&lt;/strong&gt; I was invited to the &amp;ldquo;3rd Congress of the Federation of General Medicine,&amp;rdquo; held the big tourist city of Mar de Plata, 400 km south of Buenos Aires. ** In Argentina &lt;em&gt;medicina general&lt;/em&gt; is a specialty that corresponds in some ways to &amp;ldquo;family practice&amp;rdquo; in the US. However the &lt;em&gt;médicos&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;generalistas&lt;/em&gt; within the Federation of General Medicine have a strong, action-oriented commitment to human rights and holistic development, with a focus on the underlying social and environmental determinants of health. They are strong advocates of the far-reaching structural changes needed to build a community where people live in harmony with one another and with the natural ecology. They aspire to &lt;em&gt;Health for All&lt;/em&gt; through comprehensive Primary Health Care as advocated in the Declaration of Alma Ata. The &lt;em&gt;médicos&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;generalistas&lt;/em&gt; espouse the frontline role of local &lt;em&gt;promotores de salud&lt;/em&gt; (community health workers), and to this end they make good use of my books “&lt;em&gt;Where There Is No Doctor”&lt;/em&gt; and “&lt;em&gt;Helping Health Workers Learn.”&lt;/em&gt; At the Congress both the &lt;em&gt;generalistas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;promotores&lt;/em&gt; welcomed me as old friend and comrade in the struggle for a healthier, more humane social order. As with the OTs in Chile, I felt very much at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-to-health-in-the-southern-cone:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Challenges to Health in the Southern Cone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-to-services:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Access to Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, both Chile and Argentina are currently at a level of economic prosperity that makes it feasible to provide access to general education and basic medical care to virtually everyone. Public hospitals and clinics provide care to the indigent that is essentially free of cost. In Argentina, free public health services are made available even to visiting foreigners, and reportedly there is a constant flow of sick people from poorer countries north of the border into Argentina for medical attention. (The countries in southern South America have an alliance similar to the European Union, which allows unobstructed travel from one country to the other.) While this increased level of access to services is commendable, serious problems associated with inequality, poverty, poor diet and ecological degradation remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;inequality-as-a-product-of-free-market-development:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Inequality as a product of free market &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile and Argentina are often lauded as success stories of free market policies. National health levels in these countries are much higher than in most Latin American and Caribbean countries. And, with the notable exception of Cuba, the levels of education and health tend to be higher. The free-market economic system of both countries is largely modeled after the United States—complete with its ever-expanding corporatocracy. Likewise, wealth and power are increasingly stratified. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Also, as in the US, the broad middle class is becoming more compromised as excessive personal debt becomes a lifelong trap, and the purchasing power of wages shrinks to the extent that in the average household, both husband and wife have to work to make ends meet. The growing polarization of wealth and opportunity in turn deepens social unrest and dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina has a disturbingly high rate of unemployment and underemployment. According to Bloomberg, unemployment &lt;em&gt;fell&lt;/em&gt; from 17.8% to 15.6% in May of this year! For the estimated 40 percent in the informal economy, wages are too low and uncertain to cover basic necessities. Of those living in absolute poverty, children help support their families by begging, stealing, picking through garbage, or peddling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to independent studies around 30% of the people in Argentina live in poverty, and 9% in extreme poverty. The figures provided by the government are considerably lower, to support its claims at reducing poverty – claims that some economists and sociologists say are false.  Yet rather than trying to eliminate poverty—which would require more equal redistribution of wealth and power—the government tries to mollify the worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern of health in Chile and Argentina now more closely resemble that of the &amp;ldquo;overdeveloped&amp;rdquo; countries. Ill health and death from the infectious &amp;ldquo;diseases of poverty&amp;rdquo; have largely been replaced by &amp;ldquo;diseases of a consumer society&amp;rdquo; (which doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean the &amp;ldquo;diseases of affluence&amp;rdquo;). Even in the sprawling slums of Buenos Aires and Rosario, the numbers of severely undernourished children, while substantial, are fewer than might be expected given the multitudes living in poverty (estimated at 30% of the population).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in both Argentina and Chile, one finds extensive, though inadequate, programs that provide food supplements and support services. Nevertheless, many of the biggest health problems—for both children and adults—are associated with poor diet, often coupled with obesity. A growing pandemic of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer have become the region’s major killers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, at least in the metropolitan areas (Argentina is now 82% urban!), obesity is distressingly widespread among the poor. Low income families customarily consume a lot of high-sugar, high-fat junk foods because they are cheaper, faster, and more aggressively advertised. Coca-Cola, McDonalds, KFC, and other corporate junk food outlets are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lockstep with the growth-at-all-costs development paradigm of Milton Friedman and the &amp;ldquo;Chicago Boys,&amp;rdquo; both Chile (from the days of Pinochet) and Argentina have sacrificed long-term environmental sustainability for short-term mega-profits of the ruling class. To this end, not only have health and wealth become drastically stratified, but the natural balance of whole ecosystems has been ravaged by giant extractive industries—many of them foreign owned. Excessive mining, deforestation, and giant agribusiness not only are causing environmental havoc at a local level, but contribute irresponsibly to global warming. The gigantic glaciers of the Andes—which supply much of the water for the coastal lowlands—are shrinking at an alarming rate. In Chile, to provide pulp for its burgeoning paper industry (paper is a major export), the vast natural forests have largely been replaced by huge monoculture plantations of eucalyptus and pine. These boundless commercial plantations, owned by a handful of wealthy plutocrats, acidify the soil, deplete the ground cover, and cause rapid runoff that produces excessive flooding followed by droughts. Yet Big Agro and Big Timber have such powerful political lobbies that, instead of being regulated, are heavily subsidized by government. The result is vast, short-term prosperity for the ruling class and long-term devastation for the disempowered majority. Chile&amp;rsquo;s elite have learned well from the North American model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so has Argentina. To all appearances, the country has prospered mightily from its aggressively extractive market economy. As in Chile, much of Argentina’s prosperity and growth has come from giant agribusiness, where cattle and soybeans play a very prominent role as primary exports. Soy beans, to which nutritionists and agronomists used to sing high praises, when produced on a massive scale are found to have a darker, even perilous side. The huge amount of energy consumed in the cattle industry, with its vast emission of greenhouse gasses, is a significant contributor to global warming, and its stockyards add to pollution. The mega-production of soybeans, which supply everything from stock feed to bio-fuel on the global market leaves a pernicious ecological footprint. In the vast areas where this mono-crop is planted, the integrity of the soil is fast losing ground. Because planting soybeans does not require significant plowing, but simply the opening of a small cleft to drop in the seed, the soil where the crop is grown is becoming very hard and compacted. It no longer serves as a sponge for rainwater. Instead, the surface water runs off, which causes flooding and fails to replenish the underground water table. Combined with the high use of fossil fuels, this major mechanized production is contributing to ecological demise, global warming, and pending water shortage. But in keeping with the global economy, the bottom line is &lt;em&gt;short-term economic growth for those who already have far more than their share.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, as in a number of Central and South American countries, the implementation of Free Trade Agreements (such a NAFTA in Mexico) have made it difficult for small farmers to compete with the price of subsidized US corn (maize) and other agricultural produce. This led to a massive exodus from the countryside to the cities, where a great many urban young people are unable to find employment. And for those who find jobs, basic wages are hard to survive on. With little hope for a better future, many despair and turn to drug use or trafficking, or both. As in the United States, most of the drugs used locally are imported: primarily cocaine from Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today one of the main hotspots for drug use and trafficking, with all the associated problems of crime and corruption, is the city of Rosario, 400 km north-west of Buenos Aires. Rival drug gangs compete with each other, often with the complicity of the local authorities and police. Adolescent boys, called &lt;em&gt;soldaditos&lt;/em&gt; (little soldiers), are recruited as vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/11B.png&#34;alt=&#34;*Soldaditos* (juvenile drug vendors) outside a *bunker* in Rosario.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the slums and alleyways throughout the marginal barrios, one finds tiny brick huts, called &lt;em&gt;bunkers,&lt;/em&gt; that serve as miniature “drug stores.” A &lt;em&gt;soldadito&lt;/em&gt; – to peddle the drugs without being robbed &amp;ndash; crawls into the bunker through a tiny door, which is then locked on the outside with several padlocks. The only air in the tiny brick cubicle comes in through a single hole the size of one brick, through which money and drugs are exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 8 or 10 hours, the dealer unlocks the door and the boy turns over the money he has collected and the remaining drugs. Then he is replaced by another &lt;em&gt;soldadito.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are said to be thousands of these bunkers in Rosario. Typically, the authorities make little effort to close them down, but do make periodic raids. One of the incentives for the juvenile &lt;em&gt;soldaditos&lt;/em&gt; is that they are allowed (by the mafia) to carry a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sex-change-hiv-and-elephantiasis:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Sex change, HIV, and &amp;ldquo;elephantiasis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, in spite of having a largely Catholic population, at least nominally, the culture seems to be relatively open in terms of sexual diversity. Marriage of gay couples has recently been legalized, and same-sex couples were awarded the same rights as male-female couples. There is also a strong popular movement in terms of women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive rights, including the choice of abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina prides itself in its health plan covers a wide range of personal needs and makes condoms, as well as treatment for AIDS, universally available. I was told that in the country currently over 3000 transgendered people have undergone sex change. Argentina is unique in that surgery for sex change is freely available for those who want it. A careful psychological evaluation is required prior to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many of the young people who turn to taking and selling drugs, for the cross-gender population, the lack of economic opportunity has led to problems. A significant percentage of those who have undergone sex change end up as sex workers. I was told by a couple of &lt;em&gt;médicos generalistas&lt;/em&gt; who took part in the Congress in Mar de Plata, and who work with people who are HIV positive, that in Argentina approximately 35% of sex workers are HIV positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem that various male-to-female sex-changed individuals are experiencing derives from their efforts to change their body shape. In hopes of appearing more feminine, they inject aviation oil their breast area and hips—as a low-cost alternative to silicone implants and cosmetic surgery. Apparently, licensed doctors are not involved in this procedure. The cross-gendered individuals often do it to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of this invasive procedure is that, with time, the aviation oil tends to seep downward and slowly accumulate in the lower legs and ankles, which can become so swollen that they have the appearance of elephantiasis. For this condition, virtually no treatment exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the south of Chile I had a chance, through the faculty of Occupational Therapy at Temuco Universidad Mayor, to visit a number of initiatives that address disabled peoples’ needs in the surrounding rural area, including some of the Mapuche families and collectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile is one of the few countries in Latin America where the central government has launched a national program of Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR). In implementing the CBR model, it has largely followed the guidelines of the WHO/ILO, which in practice tends to be incorrigibly hierarchical in its administration procedures, despite its rhetoric regarding the need for strong participation and leadership at the community and family levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coordinators of the national program is Eladio Recabarren, a former student of mine at the University of Boston&amp;rsquo;s School of International Public Health. Eladio used to be a leader of EPES (Educación Popular en Salud) in Santiago. He has a strong commitment to the empowerment of the underdog, and has been trying to place the national program more in the hands of the people, especially disabled persons themselves. However, Eladio is engaged in an uphill battle. Working toward similar participatory goals, the Occupational Therapy Department at the Universidad Mayor in Temuco has been forging new ground in terms of promoting a more bottom-up, participatory approach, especially in more isolated and rural communities. It was with this objective of more empowering, participatory approach to Community Based Rehabilitation, especially among the indigenous population in the rural area, that the OT Department had invited me to Temuco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples-of-cbr-activities-among-the-mapuche:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Examples of CBR activities among the Mapuche&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural areas there tends to be very little by way of rehabilitation services for disabled people. In some cases, with the assistance of OT staff and students from the Universidad Mayor, groups of mothers of disabled children have mobilized the creation of small centers to provide the needed services. An example is a group of mothers in the town of Saavedra, who organized to launch their own modest &lt;em&gt;Centro Comunitario de Rehabilitación,&lt;/em&gt; and pressured the regional office of the &lt;em&gt;Servicio Nacional de Discapacidad&lt;/em&gt; to help build and support it. This cooperative family-run program is led by Norma, a poor single mother of three disabled children, each with a different type of disability. Norma’s energy and dedication are contagious. She has motivated the group to courageously promote the acceptance and inclusion of their disabled children in the community and in local schools. They have also organized a variety of fundraising activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a field trip to Araucario Norte, we visited the Union of Children and Parents for Normal Integration, run collectively by local health workers, community organizers, disabled persons, and parents of disabled children. Next to a playground outside their small community center, on a stucco wall, they had created a colorful mural portraying disabled and non-disabled children playing together. At the Union I was welcomed with open arms. Everyone was familiar with my book, &lt;em&gt;Disabled Village Children.&lt;/em&gt; I was delighted to see they had copied drawings from it to share information about disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my visits to different community-based projects, I kept coming across cases where illustrations or information from my books were used by families to meet their children&amp;rsquo;s needs. For example, one family we visited lived in a house on a steep hill 50 feet below the traveled road. Two sisters who lived there had ataxic cerebral palsy. The family, with the help of OT students, had built a long series of rustic parallel bars, made from the trunks of young trees. These bars permitted the girls to climb up to the road independently. With pride, they demonstrated how they could do so. (As it turned out, the bars were a big help to me as well.) Another set of bars led from the back of the house to the latrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our forays to the countryside surrounding Temuco, in an area called Nuevo Imperial, we had the opportunity to visit the &lt;em&gt;Boreo Filulawén Centro de Salud Intercultural&lt;/em&gt;. This remarkable Intercultural Health Center—run by a local Committee of Mapuche community leaders and shamans from the local community—aspires to combine traditional medicine with Western medicine. Reflecting this goal, the center juxtaposes traditional buildings with modern ones. The community meeting hall, where people gather to discuss health-related problems, is in essence an oversized, traditional, oval, thatched-roofed &lt;em&gt;ruka.&lt;/em&gt; (See picture below.) The traditional healing hut is oval like a &lt;em&gt;ruka,&lt;/em&gt; but made with modern materials and painted bright blue. It is staffed by a &lt;em&gt;machi&lt;/em&gt; (traditional Mapuche healer/shaman). The allopathic medical clinic, next to the traditional healing hut, is square, architecturally more Western, and is staffed by a licensed doctor and nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for all the proximity and good will, when it comes to healing, to all appearances the two treatment centers – traditional and modern &amp;ndash; remain leagues apart. People can choose which kind of medicine they want. But there seems to be little communication between the two breeds of practitioners. Likewise few guidelines exist to help people decide when a traditional or Western medical treatment might be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Intercultural Health Center recognizes and provides both systems of healing, functional integration has not yet been fully realized. This integrative challenge is discussed, and some guidelines for choosing between modern and traditional treatment depending on the ailment, are provided in my book &lt;em&gt;Aprendiendo a Promover la Salud&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Helping Health Workers Learn).&lt;/em&gt; At the Center we had probing discussions about such concerns with the &lt;em&gt;machi&lt;/em&gt; (traditional healer) and other Mapuche staff, but the licensed doctor was unavailable during our visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of colonialism, indigenous peoples the world over have been exploited and denigrated, if not exterminated, by colonizers who took possession of their lands. This is true for native peoples throughout the Americas. In the southern cone of South America, one of the largest tribes of “original people&amp;rdquo; is the Mapuche, who still subsist in substantial numbers in the southern part of Chile and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like indigenous peoples in many parts of the world in recent years, at least some of the surviving Mapuches in southern Chile are reaffirming their traditional values and standing up for their rights, that is, the rights of &lt;em&gt;Pachamama&lt;/em&gt; (Mother Nature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chile, laws have been passed to return some of the most sacred tribal lands to the Mapuches. However, wealthy &lt;em&gt;wigka&lt;/em&gt; (non-indigenous) landlords and corrupt officials have largely blocked effective land redistribution. In response, groups of Mapuches are demanding the return of their traditional lands. In a number of towns and villages near Temuco, protests, road blocks, and confrontations with the police and landlords have taken place. Some Mapuche activists have been arrested, and several killed. But they have succeeded in regaining some of their tribal lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told by the occupational therapists who invited me to Chile that groups of Mapuches that they work with have been using my books, both on Primary Health Care and Community Based Rehabilitation, as a part of their effort to gain greater control over the determinants of their health. For this reason, community health activists and collectives of families with disabled children were eager to have me visit, to exchange ideas and experiences. In turn, I accepted this invitation as an opportunity to meet with and learn from these tribal people about their initiatives to improve the situation of disabled and vulnerable people, and to stand up both for their own rights and the rights of the Earth (which they consider deeply interconnected). This opportunity to visit tribal villages and learn from the Mapuche about their struggle for health and rehabilitation convinced me to travel to Temuco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My visit to southern Chile was indeed fascinating, and it was a great pleasure. I was warmly welcomed by everyone, on all sides of the ethnic landscape. We had a wealth of illuminating exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality of the &amp;ldquo;tribal villages” I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to visit was quite different from what I had imagined. The vast majority of Mapuches no longer live in ethnically cohesive villages. Some are in isolated farmsteads, often as peasant laborers. But most are in typical Chilean villages and towns, mixed largely into the general population. In rural areas some older women still wear traditional dress, and there are elders who still speak in their native language. But most of the younger generation converse in Spanish and wear Western clothing. On Mapuche farms one still sees an occasional &lt;em&gt;ruca,&lt;/em&gt; or traditional oval thatched hut. But &lt;em&gt;rucas&lt;/em&gt; are now used primarily for storage or as quaint little restaurants or craft stores for tourists. Most of the original people now live in mud brick or cement block houses like other low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mapuches remain the largest tribal population in southern Chile and Argentina. While in southern Chile, I had a chance to visit the ancestral heartland of the Mapuche, now conserved in the Conguillio National Park. This is certainly one of the most beautiful mountainous wilderness areas in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why the Mapuche considered this region holy. Crowning the majestic range of mountains is the towering Llaima Volcano, its twin-cratered peak flanked with slowly flowing glaciers and perennial snow, which melts only when the volcano erupts, as it still does every decade or so. And with each eruption the imposing landscape changes. When rivers of lava pour down in serpentine paths, new lakes and lagoons are formed, often leaving the skeletal tips of giant trees protruding from their surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/14Db.JPG&#34;alt=&#34;Conguillio National Park is one of the few areas in Chile where the natural environment has been preserved. Most of the ancient vast forest have been timbered and replaced by commercial eucalyptus and pine plantations&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the mystic aura, the ridges and slopes of the mountains are festooned with lush native forest, dominated by giant &lt;em&gt;Araucaria,&lt;/em&gt; or monkey-puzzle trees, which resemble pines and approach the size of the California redwood or Sequoia, with trunks up to 8 feet or more in diameter. These towering trees, far more primitive than pines and related conifers, are known to be up to 3000 years old. They grow very slowly, only 10 cm. per year, yet the biggest ones are up to 300 feet tall! They were already huge when Christ was born, and even more enormous when the Europeans first colonized the south end of the Americas and began to cut them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/14Dc.JPG&#34;alt=&#34;The *araucaria* – the national tree of Chile – is a sacred tree to the Mapuches, as well as a traditional source of food and medicine.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these sacred trees, found only in a few areas where native forests remain, are strongly protected. But the old forests, which once covered the southern half of Chile, have now been almost completely timbered, and replaced by commercial eucalypt and pine plantations which are economically lucrative for the present, but ecologically disastrous in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mapuches know this and weep. They weep for the ravaged environment with which they lived in balance for thousands of years. Their roots are interwoven with the oldest of the &lt;em&gt;Araucarias.&lt;/em&gt; As their habitat is being destroyed, so is their culture and sustainable way of life. But the Mapuche people, along with indigenous peoples in many parts of the world, are taking a stand for their rights, for the rights of nature, and ultimately for the rights of all life on this endangered planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;visit-to-a-mapuche-farmstead:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Visit to a Mapuche farmstead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Sunday during my stay in Temuco I had the chance to visit the farm of a Mapuche family, about 40 km east of the city. One of the OT staff at the University was of mixed ethnicity, and his aging Mapuche grandparents are farmers. When we arrived at their farmstead they welcomed us politely. Wary of strangers, at first they were somewhat reserved. However, as we began to discuss questions of social justice and human rights, and as I described some of the &lt;em&gt;campesinos&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; struggles for their land rights in Mexico, they warmed up. In time, the elderly grandfather, who is now overweight and diabetic, became quite lively, and told us the history of his family and his people. He explained how, in his youth, his entire village had been forced off the communal land where they had lived for generations. He told how the militia arrived, arresting him and other young men on trumped up charges, and had tortured them (essentially, water-boarded them), trying to make them incriminate others. His family sold their belongings to pay lawyers&amp;rsquo; fees, trying to win their constitutional land rights. But their efforts yielded little. In the end, his family was allotted a barren plot of land that was small, inferior, and distant from their familiar villages and ancestral land. Slowly and at great sacrifice they developed the land and managed to eke out a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mobilization of Mapuches over their land rights – and the rights of the land



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years the Mapuches were thus exploited, humiliated, and dispersed. Their children were required to go to school where they were taught in Spanish. They learned social studies from the colonial perspective. Every attempt was made to strip them of their culture and to assimilate them into the Euro-American lifestyle. But for all these attempts to eradicate their indigenous roots, a significant portion of the Mapuche held stubbornly to their sense of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scattered and displaced as they are, Mapuches have begun to organize, to reassert their traditional values. This included their age-old beliefs in the sacredness of the land. And they are demanding their ancestral rights. From their native perspective, they consider that the destruction of the environment and the extraction of its resources is a form of genocide that will bring hunger and thirst and death, first to those who are poorest and most vulnerable, and ultimately to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, a groundswell of organized action among the Mapuche is now underway. The more radical movement is demanding that the heartland of the Mapuche become an autonomous Mapuche Nation, or &lt;em&gt;Meli Wixan Mapu.&lt;/em&gt; Geographically this would extend in a broad band through south-central Chile across the Andes and well into Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;massive-mobilization:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Massive mobilization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent action, taken on April 26, 2014, was a &amp;ldquo;massive mobilization&amp;rdquo; by the ancestral Mapuche communities situated in the &lt;em&gt;Comuna de Cura Cautin&lt;/em&gt;, which is the territory of the &lt;em&gt;precordillera&lt;/em&gt; (foothills of the Andes) that includes the Conguillio National Park and the Llaina Volcano. The mobilization, in the form of an &lt;em&gt;autoconvocatorio&lt;/em&gt; (self-organized popular assembly) was led by the territorial &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;werken,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (spiritual-political leaders). The importance of the event was stated by the &lt;em&gt;werken&lt;/em&gt; Alberto Curamil, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; throughout the Mapu territory our people denounce the processes of invasion that we live with daily. Yet we have not heard any announcement or measure of concrete action by our government to reign in or deflect the disaster being unleashed by the timber industries, the commercial fisheries, the massive hydroelectric projects, the salmon farms, the transgenic crops and the pesticides that continue to poison us. We are gathered to assert our demand, not for discourse but for concrete action, with measures that guarantee things will change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip; en todo el Wallmapu y en cada zona nuestra gente denuncia y comunica los procesos de invasión que se viven a diario, no hemos escuchado el anuncio de una sola herramienta o medida concreta de parte del nuevo gobierno para frenar o siquiera torcer el desastre al que nos están arrastrando las empresas forestales, las pisciculturas, centrales hidroeléctricas, salmoneras, los transgénicos y plaguicidas que nos siguen envenenando. Nosotros nos reuniremos para exigir y para movilizarnos, no vamos por discurso sino hechos concretos, herramientas que garanticen que las cosas cambiarán”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists, or &lt;em&gt;werken,&lt;/em&gt; behind this most recent mobilization made clear that the &lt;em&gt;Fvtal Mapu Xawvn&lt;/em&gt; (Territorial Mapuche Alliance) consists of, and is led by, members of the Mapuche Nation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As such, this IS NOT A CHILEAN ORGANIZATION with functional jurisdiction in the interest of the State of Chile. Rather it is a reunion of the kind in which our forbearers gathered to converse and make decisions, where every Mapuche always had and has a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We persist with our claims as a Nation on our ancestral Mapu territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this social protest we advance our proposals in accordance with current reality and the situation of domination in which we find ourselves, where the recuperation of our territory and its ecological preservation is our central struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our struggle is real and not virtual. But we understand the necessity to communicate: to denounce to the whole world the ethnocide and genocide wrought by the Chilean state. And at the same time we value the solidarity and appreciation for our cause, which is similar to the cause of other peoples and social actors who struggle for their liberty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mobilization was held precisely in the middle of a location where the giant corporation Agricola Rio Blanco is counting on the appropriation by the Chilean government of a vast sector of land in order to construct the proposed &amp;ldquo;Hydroelectric Center de Paso Alto Cautín.&amp;rdquo; The giant dam to be built there would flood out thousands of acres of sacred Mapuche ancestral land, and in the process bring about drastic ecological degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the organizers of the protest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The collective motivation for this encounter comes from the need to let the world know the devastating blows the Chilean/Western model of development is committing against life (the land and ecosystems), in the ancestral and actual territories of the Mapuche people, in stark contradiction to international standards, both in regard to environment and to universal human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;La motivación colectiva por reencontrarse tiene que ver con la necesidad de dar a conocer al mundo los atropellos que el modelo de desarrollo chileno-occidental comete contra la vida (la tierra y sus ecosistemas), en los espacios ancestrales y actuales del pueblo mapuche, en abierta contradicción con los estándares internacionales en materias medioambientales y de los derechos de los pueblos universalmente reconocidos.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the dictatorship of Pinochet, the Mapuches, together with other disadvantaged groups, were further marginalized and exploited. But with the ousting of Pinochet and the entry of a somewhat more humane and people-centered government, they hoped to gain a greater voice with regard to their land and their rights. To a limited extent this was the case. A number of laws were passed in their favor. But the new government was still too immersed in the global economy, and primed by the powerful corporate lobby. So despite the talk of reform, exploitation of the people and the environment has largely continued. So the Mapuche have taken a stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their protests and demands for their ancestral land rights and preservation of the environment has been, of course, a serious threat to the powerful commercial and corporate interests in the country and beyond. Most threatened are the fossil fuel multinationals, the mining industry, and the timber barons, all that have been plundering the environment in their ruthless, single-minded pursuit of profit. It is no surprise, therefore, that the military and police have been sent in repeatedly to enforce “law and order.” This has resulted in heated confrontations, including arrests and violations of human rights. At times people have been attacked while peacefully working in their fields. Participants in demonstrations have been forcefully restrained and arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Mapuches have stood their ground. Even the children take pride in their culture, and stand up for their peoples’ rights and land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an encouraging sign that a growing number of the &lt;em&gt;huinca&lt;/em&gt; (non-Mapuche) citizens are recognizing and demanding the Mapuches’ right to defend their nation against the ecologically disastrous exploits of corporate interest. A broad, progressive inter-ethnic movement is growing, which looks to the long-term common good of both nature and humanity. It recognizes that we all have much to learn from the indigenous people who for millennia have lived with respect for and in intimate balance with the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/16C.JPG&#34;alt=&#34;The Mapuches traditionally felt that they belonged to the land rather than it to them. They revered the primeval forest and glacier-covered volcanos as sacred sources of life&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting, in the course of events, the way things seem to go full circle. There was a time when human beings were more attuned to the rhythms of the sun and the seasons. To a large extent &lt;em&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; relationship with the natural environment was symbiotic, or mutually beneficial. But as the human species mastered a greater range of technical skills, its dominant members began to exploit the natural world, as well as society’s vulnerable and or less aggressive members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the most assertive decision-makers of society began to define success in terms of power and possession, rather than in terms of harmony and collective action for the common good. In time this acquisitive, extractive, winner-takes-all approach to life became increasingly celebrated and globalized. This paradigm of domination and exploitation is now embodied in the &amp;ldquo;free market system&amp;rdquo; – &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; meaning free to exploit both people and the environment, while disregarding and externalizing the human and ecological costs. The mansions, private airplanes and yachts of the wealthy elite are essentially paid for by the suffering of marginalized people. And the damage to the ecosphere is so great that the future of life on the planet is now at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahatma Gandhi, when someone asked him what he thought of civilization, said, &amp;ldquo;I think it would be a good idea.&amp;rdquo; And surely, the path that the so-called civilized world has taken in recent years has, in many ways, become increasingly cruel, self-centered, and unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &amp;ldquo;Western Civilization&amp;rdquo; conquered the world and colonized its &amp;ldquo;underdeveloped&amp;rdquo; lands and peoples, those on top of the pecking order began to subjugate the &amp;ldquo;natives,&amp;rdquo; whom they regarded as subhuman. After, slaughtering, enslaving, and decimating millions, they tried to strip the remainder of their traditional customs and values, and indoctrinate them with the beliefs and values of the &amp;ldquo;civilized&amp;rdquo; invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the &amp;ldquo;natives&amp;rdquo; were recognized as human beings, and awarded some basic rights, including the right to vote. But full equality and equal opportunity still remain a distant hope for many of the world&amp;rsquo;s ethnic minorities. Overall, the indigenous peoples of many lands have remained underprivileged and marginalized. They have been browbeaten into accepting their low social status, into feeling ashamed of their traditional clothing and customs, and into embracing the values, worldview, and lifestyle of the dominating culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having internalized the oppressors&amp;rsquo; distain for their traditional way of life the surviving indigenous peoples have suffered a pervasive loss of self-esteem as well as social cohesion. The resulting hopelessness and existential despair has characteristically led, in turn, to high rates of alcoholism, drug use, unhealthy food habits (junk food), obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and other consequences of psychosocial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominating aim of the ruling colonizers, whether armed with bibles or muskets, was &amp;ldquo;to keep the natives in their place,&amp;rdquo; principally as servants, common laborers, farm-hands, and the like. Brainwashed as they were, the indigenous population frequently submitted to the subservient role assigned to them. However, some indigenous peoples courageously managed, under the surface, to preserve at least part of their ancient beliefs and philosophies of life. Above all they retained their communal values and their reverence for the natural world. This cultural resilience was more in evidence where such peoples were able to sustain the integrity of their villages, even when relegated to &amp;ldquo;reservations&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;tribal lands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latter part of the 20th century, and even more so now in the new millennium, a groundswell of reawakening has been emerging among the original peoples in many parts of earth. This reawakening may be due in part to the fact that the dominant development model of &amp;ldquo;Western Civilization&amp;rdquo; is beginning to self-destruct. The fault lines are obvious to anyone who dares to look critically at the interrelated mega-crises of today&amp;rsquo;s ailing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more, the driving force of the dominant development model—based on exploitive extraction for private ownership rather than shared productivity for the common good—is in blatant contrast to the ancient praxis of indigenous cultures. As their remaining spiritual healers and seers watch with alarm the escalating crises of today&amp;rsquo;s unbalanced world, they are rediscovering that many of their age-old customs may in fact be a wiser, more sustainable path to for human development than the dog-eat-dog, free-market paradigm of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This re-affirmation of the traditional values of indigenous peoples has become an increasingly important element in the growing movement for radical systemic change. A growing coalition among forward-thinking people in all corners of the Earth is striving to replace the moribund free-market economic paradigm with a more cooperative, more democratic approach to production and needs-meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the free-market system, in which wealth and power tend to concentrate into the few hands of a ruling elite, at the expense of the many, is anything but democratic. Increasingly, the CEOs and board members of corporations—a tiny minority—rule the workforce, and ultimately the world. It is a system that not only concentrates wealth, but controls the institutions of learning and the mass media to the point that the public is so misinformed that meaningful democratic elections and decision making are dangerously impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as wealth continues to concentrate in fewer hands, as the basic needs of more people remain unmet, as ecological systems continue to deteriorate, and global warming approaches the tipping point of no return, increasing numbers of people are beginning to wake up—and to say, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;¡Ya basta!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigenous peoples in many parts of the world are taking a stand and making demands to defend the &amp;ldquo;Rights of Nature.&amp;rdquo; As they organize and raise their voices, in some countries they have played a key role in replacing governments that primarily represent big business with ones that come closer to representing the needs of common people and of the environment. It is no accident that the two Latin American governments that are more representative of the common people and their needs are those of Bolivia and Ecuador. Both these countries have large, historically marginalized, indigenous populations that have found a voice and stood up for their own rights and the rights of the natural world. And these two countries, with a new popular voice from below, have built a declaration of those rights into their new constitutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the original peoples of Bolivia and Ecuador are not unique in declaring the rights of nature and humans against the exploits of transnational corporations. Throughout much of Latin America tribal peoples are doing battle with the giant mining and oil companies. Likewise, in the US and Canada, Native Americans are challenging the powerful corporations that are pursuing the ecologically perilous Keystone Tar-Sands Pipelines. The “Idle No More” indigenous movement based in Canada has rallied such a strong grassroots resistance to the pipeline that the governments of both Canada and the United States are now more reticent to back it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, unusual alliances of former enemies are emerging, as both &amp;ldquo;cowboys,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Indians&amp;rdquo; join forces to oppose the ominous pipelines. And those concerned about local contamination and dangers to wildlife are aligning with the climate scientists and macro-environmentalists who see the pending tsunami of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new coalitions of forward-looking people—across racial, national, and historical divides—provide a ray of hope that we humans may finally come to our senses and take the radical steps needed to prevent our species and millions of others from joining the ranks of the dodo and the dinosaur. But the systemic changes needed are profound. We the people—individually and collectively—must learn to live in harmony with one another and with the environment. We must learn to leave a much smaller ecological footprint, and to develop life styles that facilitate not only our own health, but the health of future generations and of the earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Americas and beyond, indigenous peoples have traditionally held this all-embracing vision. For example, through the ancient &amp;ldquo;Great Law of Peace,&amp;rdquo; the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) tribe of North America embraced the &lt;em&gt;Seventh Generation Principle,&lt;/em&gt; whereby all people&amp;rsquo;s actions and decisions should be guided by how they may affect the lives and well-being of their descendants seven generations into future. By the same token, other tribes—the Lakota, the Algonquin, the Cherokee—all celebrate the principle that, &amp;ldquo;We are all related to and respect everything in life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same concept is espoused by original people of Central and South America. The tribes in jungles of Ecuador uphold the guiding principle called &lt;em&gt;Sumak Kawsay&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Buen Vivir&lt;/em&gt; (Living Well), which similarly implies &lt;em&gt;a deep sense of kinship with their human and non-human neighbors.&lt;/em&gt; At the First Regional Assembly of the People&amp;rsquo;s Health Movement—Latin America, which took place in Cuenca, Ecuador in October 2014, the concept of Sumak Kawsay was the overarching theme of the Assembly. Fittingly, many of the participants in the Assembly were indigenous health workers and activists from several Latin American countries. It was very encouraging to hear them speak to the need to implement in practical ways the vision of Sumak Kawsay and the Seventh Generation Principle. The affirmation of these ancient values offers a realistic basis for the hope that a worthwhile future might still be possible for the only planet we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My exchange with representatives of the &lt;em&gt;Mapuche Nation&lt;/em&gt; in Chile, reinforced the realization that we have much to learn from indigenous and other extramural groups about ways of living which are more inclusive, respectful, and sustainable than the dead-end development paradigm that dominates today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:b9790ac8c03e5444b0785c5f90b5d73f&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I greatly enjoyed my visits to Chile and Argentina &amp;ndash; and I learned a lot. Above all, I realized more deeply that Western Civilization by no means has all the answers, and that that the model of socioeconomic development it has imposed worldwide, is in the long run, a one-way road to disaster. Every system, traditional and modern, has its strengths and its weaknesses. Such ancient concepts of the human spirit such as Seventh Generation and Sumak Kawsay—if we can open our minds and hearts to them—can help us up the steep path of transformation we must climb if we are to allow life to continue on this beautiful but ailing Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julio Monsalvo, an aging Argentine pediatrician, social activist, and coordinator of the Argentine branch of the People&amp;rsquo;s Health Movement, played an important role both in the First Assembly of the People&amp;rsquo;s Health Movement in Cuenca, Ecuador in October, 2013 (see our Newsletter 72 &amp;ndash; click here), and in the Congress of General Medicine in Mar de Plata, Argentina in April, 2014. Here are Julio&amp;rsquo;s comments on the need for radical systemic transformation, if we are to have a sustainable future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARE FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous Letters [in Julio’s blog &lt;em&gt;Esperanzas y Alegremia&lt;/em&gt;] we spoke of the Care of our Future Generations. We declared our hope that, within the maelstrom of the paraphernalia of neo-liberalism with its laws of the market and its consumerist morality, the voices of Ancient Knowledge will oblige us to consider the seventh future generation as we make decisions that affect us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidental with this Knowledge, we share the simple and overwhelming academic concept of sustainability given us by the well-known and respected Lester Brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present day society is indeed sustainable when it satisfies its own needs without denying the needs and perspectives of the future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Constitution of the Nation of Argentina also addresses the question of the care of the future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph of Article 41 of the Constitution adopted in 1994 clearly states that today’s productive activities shall not compromise the needs of future generations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All citizens have the right to a healthy and balanced environment, fit for human development,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one in which today’s productive activities satisfy present needs without compromising those of the future generations;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;today’s generation has the obligation to preserve the environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding its critical importance, a constitutional article has no value whatever if all people that live in this land, wherever they are, and whatever activities they engage in, do not incorporate the spirit of that article into themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article of the Constitution forces us to ask, &lt;em&gt;what indeed are today’s needs, and how shall we move forward so that the activities that satisfy today’s needs do not compromise those of the future generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the Victory of Life!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUIDAR LAS GENERACIONES FUTURAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venimos conversando en Cartas anteriores acerca del Cuidado de las Generaciones Futuras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decíamos de la esperanza que nos da, en medio de la parafernalia neoliberal con sus leyes del mercado y su moral consumista, que lleguen las voces de las Sabidurías Ancestrales que nos indican pensar en la séptima generación futura antes de tomar decisiones que puedan afectar el entorno.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coincidente con esas Sabidurías, compartíamos el sencillo y contundente concepto académico de sustentabilidad que nos trae el afamado y respetado Lester Brown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Es sustentable una sociedad cuando satisface sus necesidades sin afectar las perspectivas de las generaciones futuras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Constitución de la Nación Argentina también nos habla del cuidado de las generaciones futuras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;El primer párrafo del artículo 41º de la Constitución sancionada en 1994, expresa con claridad que las actividades productivas no deben comprometer las generaciones futuras:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todos los habitantes gozan del derecho a un ambiente sano, equilibrado, apto para el desarrollo humano y para &lt;strong&gt;que las actividades productivas satisfagan las necesidades presentes sin comprometer las de las generaciones futuras&lt;/strong&gt; y tienen el deber de preservarlo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Con toda la importancia que tiene lo sancionado en la Constitución, de nada vale si no se internaliza en cada persona que habita este suelo, donde quiera que esté y cualquiera que sea su actividad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Este artículo de la Constitución induce a preguntarnos cuáles son realmente las necesidades presentes y cómo proceder para que las acciones que realicemos para satisfacerlas no afecten las generaciones por venir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasta la Victoria de la Vida Siempre!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julio Monsalvo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction:9cfee32a5eabe6071ec13d132125f3c1&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english current &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of 2014, I, David Werner, was asked to visit Chile and Argentina, the two countries that flank the imposing &lt;em&gt;Cordillera de los Andes&lt;/em&gt; in South America&amp;rsquo;s southern cone. The corresponding groups that invited me – of occupational therapists and of community doctors &amp;ndash;represent the more radical, social-change-seeking arm of their respective professions, much in the way that the &amp;ldquo;Theology of Liberation&amp;rdquo; is the socially progressive arm of the Catholic Church. In sum, within their professions they are the mavericks who stand up for the rights of marginalized people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;spanish current &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eso es un poco de espanol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Chile,&lt;/strong&gt; I was invited by the School of Occupational Therapy at the &amp;ldquo;Universidad Mayor&amp;rdquo; in the southern city of Temuco. The staff of the School believes that occupational therapists should function as &amp;ldquo;agents of social change.&amp;rdquo; In addition to helping persons in situations of disability cope with the sometimes brutal realities of the existing social order, with its inequalities and barriers to inclusion, they strive to make society more egalitarian, compassionate, and welcoming of diversity. This focus on human rights and social justice as the overarching goal of OT has been emerging and expanding worldwide, though in some countries more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South Africa, a radical OT named Frank Kronenberg, in 2001, edited a groundbreaking book titled &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Occupational Therapy without Borders&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (to which I wrote the preface). I was pleased to learn that the school of OT in the Universidad Mayor uses this book, along with my handbooks, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Disabled Village Children&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing About Us Without Us,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; as basic texts. ** Staff and students there welcomed me as an old friend, and as an ally in the effort to build a healthier more inclusive society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/01a.JPG&#34;alt=&#34;My invitation to Temuco was spearheaded by Eduardo Herrera Osorio, co-director of the School of Occupational Therapy at &amp;#39;Universidad Mayor.&amp;#39; Here, on one of our field trips to visit Community Based Rehabilitation activities among the Mapuche tribal people, a traditional thatched hut, or ruca.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Argentina,&lt;/strong&gt; I was invited to the &amp;ldquo;3rd Congress of the Federation of General Medicine,&amp;rdquo; held the big tourist city of Mar de Plata, 400 km south of Buenos Aires. ** In Argentina &lt;em&gt;medicina general&lt;/em&gt; is a specialty that corresponds in some ways to &amp;ldquo;family practice&amp;rdquo; in the US. However the &lt;em&gt;médicos&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;generalistas&lt;/em&gt; within the Federation of General Medicine have a strong, action-oriented commitment to human rights and holistic development, with a focus on the underlying social and environmental determinants of health. They are strong advocates of the far-reaching structural changes needed to build a community where people live in harmony with one another and with the natural ecology. They aspire to &lt;em&gt;Health for All&lt;/em&gt; through comprehensive Primary Health Care as advocated in the Declaration of Alma Ata. The &lt;em&gt;médicos&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;generalistas&lt;/em&gt; espouse the frontline role of local &lt;em&gt;promotores de salud&lt;/em&gt; (community health workers), and to this end they make good use of my books “&lt;em&gt;Where There Is No Doctor”&lt;/em&gt; and “&lt;em&gt;Helping Health Workers Learn.”&lt;/em&gt; At the Congress both the &lt;em&gt;generalistas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;promotores&lt;/em&gt; welcomed me as old friend and comrade in the struggle for a healthier, more humane social order. As with the OTs in Chile, I felt very much at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, both Chile and Argentina are currently at a level of economic prosperity that makes it feasible to provide access to general education and basic medical care to virtually everyone. Public hospitals and clinics provide care to the indigent that is essentially free of cost. In Argentina, free public health services are made available even to visiting foreigners, and reportedly there is a constant flow of sick people from poorer countries north of the border into Argentina for medical attention. (The countries in southern South America have an alliance similar to the European Union, which allows unobstructed travel from one country to the other.) While this increased level of access to services is commendable, serious problems associated with inequality, poverty, poor diet and ecological degradation remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile and Argentina are often lauded as success stories of free market policies. National health levels in these countries are much higher than in most Latin American and Caribbean countries. And, with the notable exception of Cuba, the levels of education and health tend to be higher. The free-market economic system of both countries is largely modeled after the United States—complete with its ever-expanding corporatocracy. Likewise, wealth and power are increasingly stratified. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Also, as in the US, the broad middle class is becoming more compromised as excessive personal debt becomes a lifelong trap, and the purchasing power of wages shrinks to the extent that in the average household, both husband and wife have to work to make ends meet. The growing polarization of wealth and opportunity in turn deepens social unrest and dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina has a disturbingly high rate of unemployment and underemployment. According to Bloomberg, unemployment &lt;em&gt;fell&lt;/em&gt; from 17.8% to 15.6% in May of this year! For the estimated 40 percent in the informal economy, wages are too low and uncertain to cover basic necessities. Of those living in absolute poverty, children help support their families by begging, stealing, picking through garbage, or peddling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to independent studies around 30% of the people in Argentina live in poverty, and 9% in extreme poverty. The figures provided by the government are considerably lower, to support its claims at reducing poverty – claims that some economists and sociologists say are false.  Yet rather than trying to eliminate poverty—which would require more equal redistribution of wealth and power—the government tries to mollify the worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of health in Chile and Argentina now more closely resemble that of the &amp;ldquo;overdeveloped&amp;rdquo; countries. Ill health and death from the infectious &amp;ldquo;diseases of poverty&amp;rdquo; have largely been replaced by &amp;ldquo;diseases of a consumer society&amp;rdquo; (which doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean the &amp;ldquo;diseases of affluence&amp;rdquo;). Even in the sprawling slums of Buenos Aires and Rosario, the numbers of severely undernourished children, while substantial, are fewer than might be expected given the multitudes living in poverty (estimated at 30% of the population).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today in both Argentina and Chile, one finds extensive, though inadequate, programs that provide food supplements and support services. Nevertheless, many of the biggest health problems—for both children and adults—are associated with poor diet, often coupled with obesity. A growing pandemic of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer have become the region’s major killers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, at least in the metropolitan areas (Argentina is now 82% urban!), obesity is distressingly widespread among the poor. Low income families customarily consume a lot of high-sugar, high-fat junk foods because they are cheaper, faster, and more aggressively advertised. Coca-Cola, McDonalds, KFC, and other corporate junk food outlets are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lockstep with the growth-at-all-costs development paradigm of Milton Friedman and the &amp;ldquo;Chicago Boys,&amp;rdquo; both Chile (from the days of Pinochet) and Argentina have sacrificed long-term environmental sustainability for short-term mega-profits of the ruling class. To this end, not only have health and wealth become drastically stratified, but the natural balance of whole ecosystems has been ravaged by giant extractive industries—many of them foreign owned. Excessive mining, deforestation, and giant agribusiness not only are causing environmental havoc at a local level, but contribute irresponsibly to global warming. The gigantic glaciers of the Andes—which supply much of the water for the coastal lowlands—are shrinking at an alarming rate. In Chile, to provide pulp for its burgeoning paper industry (paper is a major export), the vast natural forests have largely been replaced by huge monoculture plantations of eucalyptus and pine. These boundless commercial plantations, owned by a handful of wealthy plutocrats, acidify the soil, deplete the ground cover, and cause rapid runoff that produces excessive flooding followed by droughts. Yet Big Agro and Big Timber have such powerful political lobbies that, instead of being regulated, are heavily subsidized by government. The result is vast, short-term prosperity for the ruling class and long-term devastation for the disempowered majority. Chile&amp;rsquo;s elite have learned well from the North American model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://images.healthwrights.org/newsletters/74/w640/09C.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;A monoculture eucalyptus plantation. Millions of acres of native forest in Chile have been replaced by eucalyptus and pine plantations, which contribute to environmental demise and water shortage&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so has Argentina. To all appearances, the country has prospered mightily from its aggressively extractive market economy. As in Chile, much of Argentina’s prosperity and growth has come from giant agribusiness, where cattle and soybeans play a very prominent role as primary exports. Soy beans, to which nutritionists and agronomists used to sing high praises, when produced on a massive scale are found to have a darker, even perilous side. The huge amount of energy consumed in the cattle industry, with its vast emission of greenhouse gasses, is a significant contributor to global warming, and its stockyards add to pollution. The mega-production of soybeans, which supply everything from stock feed to bio-fuel on the global market leaves a pernicious ecological footprint. In the vast areas where this mono-crop is planted, the integrity of the soil is fast losing ground. Because planting soybeans does not require significant plowing, but simply the opening of a small cleft to drop in the seed, the soil where the crop is grown is becoming very hard and compacted. It no longer serves as a sponge for rainwater. Instead, the surface water runs off, which causes flooding and fails to replenish the underground water table. Combined with the high use of fossil fuels, this major mechanized production is contributing to ecological demise, global warming, and pending water shortage. But in keeping with the global economy, the bottom line is &lt;em&gt;short-term economic growth for those who already have far more than their share.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, as in a number of Central and South American countries, the implementation of Free Trade Agreements (such a NAFTA in Mexico) have made it difficult for small farmers to compete with the price of subsidized US corn (maize) and other agricultural produce. This led to a massive exodus from the countryside to the cities, where a great many urban young people are unable to find employment. And for those who find jobs, basic wages are hard to survive on. With little hope for a better future, many despair and turn to drug use or trafficking, or both. As in the United States, most of the drugs used locally are imported: primarily cocaine from Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today one of the main hotspots for drug use and trafficking, with all the associated problems of crime and corruption, is the city of Rosario, 400 km north-west of Buenos Aires. Rival drug gangs compete with each other, often with the complicity of the local authorities and police. Adolescent boys, called &lt;em&gt;soldaditos&lt;/em&gt; (little soldiers), are recruited as vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;right &#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the slums and alleyways throughout the marginal barrios, one finds tiny brick huts, called &lt;em&gt;bunkers,&lt;/em&gt; that serve as miniature “drug stores.” A &lt;em&gt;soldadito&lt;/em&gt; – to peddle the drugs without being robbed &amp;ndash; crawls into the bunker through a tiny door, which is then locked on the outside with several padlocks. The only air in the tiny brick cubicle comes in through a single hole the size of one brick, through which money and drugs are exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 8 or 10 hours, the dealer unlocks the door and the boy turns over the money he has collected and the remaining drugs. Then he is replaced by another &lt;em&gt;soldadito.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are said to be thousands of these bunkers in Rosario. Typically, the authorities make little effort to close them down, but do make periodic raids. One of the incentives for the juvenile &lt;em&gt;soldaditos&lt;/em&gt; is that they are allowed (by the mafia) to carry a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, in spite of having a largely Catholic population, at least nominally, the culture seems to be relatively open in terms of sexual diversity. Marriage of gay couples has recently been legalized, and same-sex couples were awarded the same rights as male-female couples. There is also a strong popular movement in terms of women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive rights, including the choice of abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina prides itself in its health plan covers a wide range of personal needs and makes condoms, as well as treatment for AIDS, universally available. I was told that in the country currently over 3000 transgendered people have undergone sex change. Argentina is unique in that surgery for sex change is freely available for those who want it. A careful psychological evaluation is required prior to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many of the young people who turn to taking and selling drugs, for the cross-gender population, the lack of economic opportunity has led to problems. A significant percentage of those who have undergone sex change end up as sex workers. I was told by a couple of &lt;em&gt;médicos generalistas&lt;/em&gt; who took part in the Congress in Mar de Plata, and who work with people who are HIV positive, that in Argentina approximately 35% of sex workers are HIV positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem that various male-to-female sex-changed individuals are experiencing derives from their efforts to change their body shape. In hopes of appearing more feminine, they inject aviation oil their breast area and hips—as a low-cost alternative to silicone implants and cosmetic surgery. Apparently, licensed doctors are not involved in this procedure. The cross-gendered individuals often do it to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of this invasive procedure is that, with time, the aviation oil tends to seep downward and slowly accumulate in the lower legs and ankles, which can become so swollen that they have the appearance of elephantiasis. For this condition, virtually no treatment exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I met with mothers at the *Centro Comunitario de Rehabilitación* in Saavedra, which they had started with the help of the OT school in Temuco.



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the south of Chile I had a chance, through the faculty of Occupational Therapy at Temuco Universidad Mayor, to visit a number of initiatives that address disabled peoples’ needs in the surrounding rural area, including some of the Mapuche families and collectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile is one of the few countries in Latin America where the central government has launched a national program of Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR). In implementing the CBR model, it has largely followed the guidelines of the WHO/ILO, which in practice tends to be incorrigibly hierarchical in its administration procedures, despite its rhetoric regarding the need for strong participation and leadership at the community and family levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coordinators of the national program is Eladio Recabarren, a former student of mine at the University of Boston&amp;rsquo;s School of International Public Health. Eladio used to be a leader of EPES (Educación Popular en Salud) in Santiago. He has a strong commitment to the empowerment of the underdog, and has been trying to place the national program more in the hands of the people, especially disabled persons themselves. However, Eladio is engaged in an uphill battle. Working toward similar participatory goals, the Occupational Therapy Department at the Universidad Mayor in Temuco has been forging new ground in terms of promoting a more bottom-up, participatory approach, especially in more isolated and rural communities. It was with this objective of more empowering, participatory approach to Community Based Rehabilitation, especially among the indigenous population in the rural area, that the OT Department had invited me to Temuco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples-of-cbr-activities-among-the-mapuche:9cfee32a5eabe6071ec13d132125f3c1&#34;&gt;Examples of CBR activities among the Mapuche&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rural areas there tends to be very little by way of rehabilitation services for disabled people. In some cases, with the assistance of OT staff and students from the Universidad Mayor, groups of mothers of disabled children have mobilized the creation of small centers to provide the needed services. An example is a group of mothers in the town of Saavedra, who organized to launch their own modest &lt;em&gt;Centro Comunitario de Rehabilitación,&lt;/em&gt; and pressured the regional office of the &lt;em&gt;Servicio Nacional de Discapacidad&lt;/em&gt; to help build and support it. This cooperative family-run program is led by Norma, a poor single mother of three disabled children, each with a different type of disability. Norma’s energy and dedication are contagious. She has motivated the group to courageously promote the acceptance and inclusion of their disabled children in the community and in local schools. They have also organized a variety of fundraising activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a field trip to Araucario Norte, we visited the Union of Children and Parents for Normal Integration, run collectively by local health workers, community organizers, disabled persons, and parents of disabled children. Next to a playground outside their small community center, on a stucco wall, they had created a colorful mural portraying disabled and non-disabled children playing together. At the Union I was welcomed with open arms. Everyone was familiar with my book, &lt;em&gt;Disabled Village Children.&lt;/em&gt; I was delighted to see they had copied drawings from it to share information about disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my visits to different community-based projects, I kept coming across cases where illustrations or information from my books were used by families to meet their children&amp;rsquo;s needs. For example, one family we visited lived in a house on a steep hill 50 feet below the traveled road. Two sisters who lived there had ataxic cerebral palsy. The family, with the help of OT students, had built a long series of rustic parallel bars, made from the trunks of young trees. These bars permitted the girls to climb up to the road independently. With pride, they demonstrated how they could do so. (As it turned out, the bars were a big help to me as well.) Another set of bars led from the back of the house to the latrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our forays to the countryside surrounding Temuco, in an area called Nuevo Imperial, we had the opportunity to visit the &lt;em&gt;Boreo Filulawén Centro de Salud Intercultural&lt;/em&gt;. This remarkable Intercultural Health Center—run by a local Committee of Mapuche community leaders and shamans from the local community—aspires to combine traditional medicine with Western medicine. Reflecting this goal, the center juxtaposes traditional buildings with modern ones. The community meeting hall, where people gather to discuss health-related problems, is in essence an oversized, traditional, oval, thatched-roofed &lt;em&gt;ruka.&lt;/em&gt; (See picture below.) The traditional healing hut is oval like a &lt;em&gt;ruka,&lt;/em&gt; but made with modern materials and painted bright blue. It is staffed by a &lt;em&gt;machi&lt;/em&gt; (traditional Mapuche healer/shaman). The allopathic medical clinic, next to the traditional healing hut, is square, architecturally more Western, and is staffed by a licensed doctor and nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;center &#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all the proximity and good will, when it comes to healing, to all appearances the two treatment centers – traditional and modern &amp;ndash; remain leagues apart. People can choose which kind of medicine they want. But there seems to be little communication between the two breeds of practitioners. Likewise few guidelines exist to help people decide when a traditional or Western medical treatment might be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Intercultural Health Center recognizes and provides both systems of healing, functional integration has not yet been fully realized. This integrative challenge is discussed, and some guidelines for choosing between modern and traditional treatment depending on the ailment, are provided in my book &lt;em&gt;Aprendiendo a Promover la Salud&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Helping Health Workers Learn).&lt;/em&gt; At the Center we had probing discussions about such concerns with the &lt;em&gt;machi&lt;/em&gt; (traditional healer) and other Mapuche staff, but the licensed doctor was unavailable during our visit.&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years the Mapuches have been rediscovering their traditions and reasserting their rights



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of colonialism, indigenous peoples the world over have been exploited and denigrated, if not exterminated, by colonizers who took possession of their lands. This is true for native peoples throughout the Americas. In the southern cone of South America, one of the largest tribes of “original people&amp;rdquo; is the Mapuche, who still subsist in substantial numbers in the southern part of Chile and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like indigenous peoples in many parts of the world in recent years, at least some of the surviving Mapuches in southern Chile are reaffirming their traditional values and standing up for their rights, that is, the rights of &lt;em&gt;Pachamama&lt;/em&gt; (Mother Nature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chile, laws have been passed to return some of the most sacred tribal lands to the Mapuches. However, wealthy &lt;em&gt;wigka&lt;/em&gt; (non-indigenous) landlords and corrupt officials have largely blocked effective land redistribution. In response, groups of Mapuches are demanding the return of their traditional lands. In a number of towns and villages near Temuco, protests, road blocks, and confrontations with the police and landlords have taken place. Some Mapuche activists have been arrested, and several killed. But they have succeeded in regaining some of their tribal lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;left &#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told by the occupational therapists who invited me to Chile that groups of Mapuches that they work with have been using my books, both on Primary Health Care and Community Based Rehabilitation, as a part of their effort to gain greater control over the determinants of their health. For this reason, community health activists and collectives of families with disabled children were eager to have me visit, to exchange ideas and experiences. In turn, I accepted this invitation as an opportunity to meet with and learn from these tribal people about their initiatives to improve the situation of disabled and vulnerable people, and to stand up both for their own rights and the rights of the Earth (which they consider deeply interconnected). This opportunity to visit tribal villages and learn from the Mapuche about their struggle for health and rehabilitation convinced me to travel to Temuco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My visit to southern Chile was indeed fascinating, and it was a great pleasure. I was warmly welcomed by everyone, on all sides of the ethnic landscape. We had a wealth of illuminating exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reality of the &amp;ldquo;tribal villages” I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to visit was quite different from what I had imagined. The vast majority of Mapuches no longer live in ethnically cohesive villages. Some are in isolated farmsteads, often as peasant laborers. But most are in typical Chilean villages and towns, mixed largely into the general population. In rural areas some older women still wear traditional dress, and there are elders who still speak in their native language. But most of the younger generation converse in Spanish and wear Western clothing. On Mapuche farms one still sees an occasional &lt;em&gt;ruca,&lt;/em&gt; or traditional oval thatched hut. But &lt;em&gt;rucas&lt;/em&gt; are now used primarily for storage or as quaint little restaurants or craft stores for tourists. Most of the original people now live in mud brick or cement block houses like other low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mapuches remain the largest tribal population in southern Chile and Argentina. While in southern Chile, I had a chance to visit the ancestral heartland of the Mapuche, now conserved in the Conguillio National Park. This is certainly one of the most beautiful mountainous wilderness areas in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why the Mapuche considered this region holy. Crowning the majestic range of mountains is the towering Llaima Volcano, its twin-cratered peak flanked with slowly flowing glaciers and perennial snow, which melts only when the volcano erupts, as it still does every decade or so. And with each eruption the imposing landscape changes. When rivers of lava pour down in serpentine paths, new lakes and lagoons are formed, often leaving the skeletal tips of giant trees protruding from their surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the mystic aura, the ridges and slopes of the mountains are festooned with lush native forest, dominated by giant &lt;em&gt;Araucaria,&lt;/em&gt; or monkey-puzzle trees, which resemble pines and approach the size of the California redwood or Sequoia, with trunks up to 8 feet or more in diameter. These towering trees, far more primitive than pines and related conifers, are known to be up to 3000 years old. They grow very slowly, only 10 cm. per year, yet the biggest ones are up to 300 feet tall! They were already huge when Christ was born, and even more enormous when the Europeans first colonized the south end of the Americas and began to cut them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these sacred trees, found only in a few areas where native forests remain, are strongly protected. But the old forests, which once covered the southern half of Chile, have now been almost completely timbered, and replaced by commercial eucalypt and pine plantations which are economically lucrative for the present, but ecologically disastrous in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mapuches know this and weep. They weep for the ravaged environment with which they lived in balance for thousands of years. Their roots are interwoven with the oldest of the &lt;em&gt;Araucarias.&lt;/em&gt; As their habitat is being destroyed, so is their culture and sustainable way of life. But the Mapuche people, along with indigenous peoples in many parts of the world, are taking a stand for their rights, for the rights of nature, and ultimately for the rights of all life on this endangered planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Sunday during my stay in Temuco I had the chance to visit the farm of a Mapuche family, about 40 km east of the city. One of the OT staff at the University was of mixed ethnicity, and his aging Mapuche grandparents are farmers. When we arrived at their farmstead they welcomed us politely. Wary of strangers, at first they were somewhat reserved. However, as we began to discuss questions of social justice and human rights, and as I described some of the &lt;em&gt;campesinos&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; struggles for their land rights in Mexico, they warmed up. In time, the elderly grandfather, who is now overweight and diabetic, became quite lively, and told us the history of his family and his people. He explained how, in his youth, his entire village had been forced off the communal land where they had lived for generations. He told how the militia arrived, arresting him and other young men on trumped up charges, and had tortured them (essentially, water-boarded them), trying to make them incriminate others. His family sold their belongings to pay lawyers&amp;rsquo; fees, trying to win their constitutional land rights. But their efforts yielded little. In the end, his family was allotted a barren plot of land that was small, inferior, and distant from their familiar villages and ancestral land. Slowly and at great sacrifice they developed the land and managed to eke out a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years the Mapuches were thus exploited, humiliated, and dispersed. Their children were required to go to school where they were taught in Spanish. They learned social studies from the colonial perspective. Every attempt was made to strip them of their culture and to assimilate them into the Euro-American lifestyle. But for all these attempts to eradicate their indigenous roots, a significant portion of the Mapuche held stubbornly to their sense of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scattered and displaced as they are, Mapuches have begun to organize, to reassert their traditional values. This included their age-old beliefs in the sacredness of the land. And they are demanding their ancestral rights. From their native perspective, they consider that the destruction of the environment and the extraction of its resources is a form of genocide that will bring hunger and thirst and death, first to those who are poorest and most vulnerable, and ultimately to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a groundswell of organized action among the Mapuche is now underway. The more radical movement is demanding that the heartland of the Mapuche become an autonomous Mapuche Nation, or &lt;em&gt;Meli Wixan Mapu.&lt;/em&gt; Geographically this would extend in a broad band through south-central Chile across the Andes and well into Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;massive-mobilization:9cfee32a5eabe6071ec13d132125f3c1&#34;&gt;Massive mobilization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent action, taken on April 26, 2014, was a &amp;ldquo;massive mobilization&amp;rdquo; by the ancestral Mapuche communities situated in the &lt;em&gt;Comuna de Cura Cautin&lt;/em&gt;, which is the territory of the &lt;em&gt;precordillera&lt;/em&gt; (foothills of the Andes) that includes the Conguillio National Park and the Llaina Volcano. The mobilization, in the form of an &lt;em&gt;autoconvocatorio&lt;/em&gt; (self-organized popular assembly) was led by the territorial &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;werken,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (spiritual-political leaders). The importance of the event was stated by the &lt;em&gt;werken&lt;/em&gt; Alberto Curamil, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; throughout the Mapu territory our people denounce the processes of invasion that we live with daily. Yet we have not heard any announcement or measure of concrete action by our government to reign in or deflect the disaster being unleashed by the timber industries, the commercial fisheries, the massive hydroelectric projects, the salmon farms, the transgenic crops and the pesticides that continue to poison us. We are gathered to assert our demand, not for discourse but for concrete action, with measures that guarantee things will change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip; en todo el Wallmapu y en cada zona nuestra gente denuncia y comunica los procesos de invasión que se viven a diario, no hemos escuchado el anuncio de una sola herramienta o medida concreta de parte del nuevo gobierno para frenar o siquiera torcer el desastre al que nos están arrastrando las empresas forestales, las pisciculturas, centrales hidroeléctricas, salmoneras, los transgénicos y plaguicidas que nos siguen envenenando. Nosotros nos reuniremos para exigir y para movilizarnos, no vamos por discurso sino hechos concretos, herramientas que garanticen que las cosas cambiarán”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists, or &lt;em&gt;werken,&lt;/em&gt; behind this most recent mobilization made clear that the &lt;em&gt;Fvtal Mapu Xawvn&lt;/em&gt; (Territorial Mapuche Alliance) consists of, and is led by, members of the Mapuche Nation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As such, this IS NOT A CHILEAN ORGANIZATION with functional jurisdiction in the interest of the State of Chile. Rather it is a reunion of the kind in which our forbearers gathered to converse and make decisions, where every Mapuche always had and has a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We persist with our claims as a Nation on our ancestral Mapu territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this social protest we advance our proposals in accordance with current reality and the situation of domination in which we find ourselves, where the recuperation of our territory and its ecological preservation is our central struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our struggle is real and not virtual. But we understand the necessity to communicate: to denounce to the whole world the ethnocide and genocide wrought by the Chilean state. And at the same time we value the solidarity and appreciation for our cause, which is similar to the cause of other peoples and social actors who struggle for their liberty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mobilization was held precisely in the middle of a location where the giant corporation Agricola Rio Blanco is counting on the appropriation by the Chilean government of a vast sector of land in order to construct the proposed &amp;ldquo;Hydroelectric Center de Paso Alto Cautín.&amp;rdquo; The giant dam to be built there would flood out thousands of acres of sacred Mapuche ancestral land, and in the process bring about drastic ecological degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the organizers of the protest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The collective motivation for this encounter comes from the need to let the world know the devastating blows the Chilean/Western model of development is committing against life (the land and ecosystems), in the ancestral and actual territories of the Mapuche people, in stark contradiction to international standards, both in regard to environment and to universal human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;La motivación colectiva por reencontrarse tiene que ver con la necesidad de dar a conocer al mundo los atropellos que el modelo de desarrollo chileno-occidental comete contra la vida (la tierra y sus ecosistemas), en los espacios ancestrales y actuales del pueblo mapuche, en abierta contradicción con los estándares internacionales en materias medioambientales y de los derechos de los pueblos universalmente reconocidos.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the dictatorship of Pinochet, the Mapuches, together with other disadvantaged groups, were further marginalized and exploited. But with the ousting of Pinochet and the entry of a somewhat more humane and people-centered government, they hoped to gain a greater voice with regard to their land and their rights. To a limited extent this was the case. A number of laws were passed in their favor. But the new government was still too immersed in the global economy, and primed by the powerful corporate lobby. So despite the talk of reform, exploitation of the people and the environment has largely continued. So the Mapuche have taken a stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their protests and demands for their ancestral land rights and preservation of the environment has been, of course, a serious threat to the powerful commercial and corporate interests in the country and beyond. Most threatened are the fossil fuel multinationals, the mining industry, and the timber barons, all that have been plundering the environment in their ruthless, single-minded pursuit of profit. It is no surprise, therefore, that the military and police have been sent in repeatedly to enforce “law and order.” This has resulted in heated confrontations, including arrests and violations of human rights. At times people have been attacked while peacefully working in their fields. Participants in demonstrations have been forcefully restrained and arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an encouraging sign that a growing number of the &lt;em&gt;huinca&lt;/em&gt; (non-Mapuche) citizens are recognizing and demanding the Mapuches’ right to defend their nation against the ecologically disastrous exploits of corporate interest. A broad, progressive inter-ethnic movement is growing, which looks to the long-term common good of both nature and humanity. It recognizes that we all have much to learn from the indigenous people who for millennia have lived with respect for and in intimate balance with the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting, in the course of events, the way things seem to go full circle. There was a time when human beings were more attuned to the rhythms of the sun and the seasons. To a large extent &lt;em&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; relationship with the natural environment was symbiotic, or mutually beneficial. But as the human species mastered a greater range of technical skills, its dominant members began to exploit the natural world, as well as society’s vulnerable and or less aggressive members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the most assertive decision-makers of society began to define success in terms of power and possession, rather than in terms of harmony and collective action for the common good. In time this acquisitive, extractive, winner-takes-all approach to life became increasingly celebrated and globalized. This paradigm of domination and exploitation is now embodied in the &amp;ldquo;free market system&amp;rdquo; – &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; meaning free to exploit both people and the environment, while disregarding and externalizing the human and ecological costs. The mansions, private airplanes and yachts of the wealthy elite are essentially paid for by the suffering of marginalized people. And the damage to the ecosphere is so great that the future of life on the planet is now at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahatma Gandhi, when someone asked him what he thought of civilization, said, &amp;ldquo;I think it would be a good idea.&amp;rdquo; And surely, the path that the so-called civilized world has taken in recent years has, in many ways, become increasingly cruel, self-centered, and unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &amp;ldquo;Western Civilization&amp;rdquo; conquered the world and colonized its &amp;ldquo;underdeveloped&amp;rdquo; lands and peoples, those on top of the pecking order began to subjugate the &amp;ldquo;natives,&amp;rdquo; whom they regarded as subhuman. After, slaughtering, enslaving, and decimating millions, they tried to strip the remainder of their traditional customs and values, and indoctrinate them with the beliefs and values of the &amp;ldquo;civilized&amp;rdquo; invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the &amp;ldquo;natives&amp;rdquo; were recognized as human beings, and awarded some basic rights, including the right to vote. But full equality and equal opportunity still remain a distant hope for many of the world&amp;rsquo;s ethnic minorities. Overall, the indigenous peoples of many lands have remained underprivileged and marginalized. They have been browbeaten into accepting their low social status, into feeling ashamed of their traditional clothing and customs, and into embracing the values, worldview, and lifestyle of the dominating culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having internalized the oppressors&amp;rsquo; distain for their traditional way of life the surviving indigenous peoples have suffered a pervasive loss of self-esteem as well as social cohesion. The resulting hopelessness and existential despair has characteristically led, in turn, to high rates of alcoholism, drug use, unhealthy food habits (junk food), obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and other consequences of psychosocial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predominating aim of the ruling colonizers, whether armed with bibles or muskets, was &amp;ldquo;to keep the natives in their place,&amp;rdquo; principally as servants, common laborers, farm-hands, and the like. Brainwashed as they were, the indigenous population frequently submitted to the subservient role assigned to them. However, some indigenous peoples courageously managed, under the surface, to preserve at least part of their ancient beliefs and philosophies of life. Above all they retained their communal values and their reverence for the natural world. This cultural resilience was more in evidence where such peoples were able to sustain the integrity of their villages, even when relegated to &amp;ldquo;reservations&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;tribal lands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter part of the 20th century, and even more so now in the new millennium, a groundswell of reawakening has been emerging among the original peoples in many parts of earth. This reawakening may be due in part to the fact that the dominant development model of &amp;ldquo;Western Civilization&amp;rdquo; is beginning to self-destruct. The fault lines are obvious to anyone who dares to look critically at the interrelated mega-crises of today&amp;rsquo;s ailing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more, the driving force of the dominant development model—based on exploitive extraction for private ownership rather than shared productivity for the common good—is in blatant contrast to the ancient praxis of indigenous cultures. As their remaining spiritual healers and seers watch with alarm the escalating crises of today&amp;rsquo;s unbalanced world, they are rediscovering that many of their age-old customs may in fact be a wiser, more sustainable path to for human development than the dog-eat-dog, free-market paradigm of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This re-affirmation of the traditional values of indigenous peoples has become an increasingly important element in the growing movement for radical systemic change. A growing coalition among forward-thinking people in all corners of the Earth is striving to replace the moribund free-market economic paradigm with a more cooperative, more democratic approach to production and needs-meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the free-market system, in which wealth and power tend to concentrate into the few hands of a ruling elite, at the expense of the many, is anything but democratic. Increasingly, the CEOs and board members of corporations—a tiny minority—rule the workforce, and ultimately the world. It is a system that not only concentrates wealth, but controls the institutions of learning and the mass media to the point that the public is so misinformed that meaningful democratic elections and decision making are dangerously impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as wealth continues to concentrate in fewer hands, as the basic needs of more people remain unmet, as ecological systems continue to deteriorate, and global warming approaches the tipping point of no return, increasing numbers of people are beginning to wake up—and to say, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;¡Ya basta!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indigenous peoples in many parts of the world are taking a stand and making demands to defend the &amp;ldquo;Rights of Nature.&amp;rdquo; As they organize and raise their voices, in some countries they have played a key role in replacing governments that primarily represent big business with ones that come closer to representing the needs of common people and of the environment. It is no accident that the two Latin American governments that are more representative of the common people and their needs are those of Bolivia and Ecuador. Both these countries have large, historically marginalized, indigenous populations that have found a voice and stood up for their own rights and the rights of the natural world. And these two countries, with a new popular voice from below, have built a declaration of those rights into their new constitutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the original peoples of Bolivia and Ecuador are not unique in declaring the rights of nature and humans against the exploits of transnational corporations. Throughout much of Latin America tribal peoples are doing battle with the giant mining and oil companies. Likewise, in the US and Canada, Native Americans are challenging the powerful corporations that are pursuing the ecologically perilous Keystone Tar-Sands Pipelines. The “Idle No More” indigenous movement based in Canada has rallied such a strong grassroots resistance to the pipeline that the governments of both Canada and the United States are now more reticent to back it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, unusual alliances of former enemies are emerging, as both &amp;ldquo;cowboys,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Indians&amp;rdquo; join forces to oppose the ominous pipelines. And those concerned about local contamination and dangers to wildlife are aligning with the climate scientists and macro-environmentalists who see the pending tsunami of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new coalitions of forward-looking people—across racial, national, and historical divides—provide a ray of hope that we humans may finally come to our senses and take the radical steps needed to prevent our species and millions of others from joining the ranks of the dodo and the dinosaur. But the systemic changes needed are profound. We the people—individually and collectively—must learn to live in harmony with one another and with the environment. We must learn to leave a much smaller ecological footprint, and to develop life styles that facilitate not only our own health, but the health of future generations and of the earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Americas and beyond, indigenous peoples have traditionally held this all-embracing vision. For example, through the ancient &amp;ldquo;Great Law of Peace,&amp;rdquo; the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) tribe of North America embraced the &lt;em&gt;Seventh Generation Principle,&lt;/em&gt; whereby all people&amp;rsquo;s actions and decisions should be guided by how they may affect the lives and well-being of their descendants seven generations into future. By the same token, other tribes—the Lakota, the Algonquin, the Cherokee—all celebrate the principle that, &amp;ldquo;We are all related to and respect everything in life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same concept is espoused by original people of Central and South America. The tribes in jungles of Ecuador uphold the guiding principle called &lt;em&gt;Sumak Kawsay&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Buen Vivir&lt;/em&gt; (Living Well), which similarly implies &lt;em&gt;a deep sense of kinship with their human and non-human neighbors.&lt;/em&gt; At the First Regional Assembly of the People&amp;rsquo;s Health Movement—Latin America, which took place in Cuenca, Ecuador in October 2014, the concept of Sumak Kawsay was the overarching theme of the Assembly. Fittingly, many of the participants in the Assembly were indigenous health workers and activists from several Latin American countries. It was very encouraging to hear them speak to the need to implement in practical ways the vision of Sumak Kawsay and the Seventh Generation Principle. The affirmation of these ancient values offers a realistic basis for the hope that a worthwhile future might still be possible for the only planet we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My exchange with representatives of the &lt;em&gt;Mapuche Nation&lt;/em&gt; in Chile, reinforced the realization that we have much to learn from indigenous and other extramural groups about ways of living which are more inclusive, respectful, and sustainable than the dead-end development paradigm that dominates today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:9cfee32a5eabe6071ec13d132125f3c1&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I greatly enjoyed my visits to Chile and Argentina &amp;ndash; and I learned a lot. Above all, I realized more deeply that Western Civilization by no means has all the answers, and that that the model of socioeconomic development it has imposed worldwide, is in the long run, a one-way road to disaster. Every system, traditional and modern, has its strengths and its weaknesses. Such ancient concepts of the human spirit such as Seventh Generation and Sumak Kawsay—if we can open our minds and hearts to them—can help us up the steep path of transformation we must climb if we are to allow life to continue on this beautiful but ailing Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Julio Monsalvo at the 3rd *Congress of General Medicine* in Mar de Plata



&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julio Monsalvo, an aging Argentine pediatrician, social activist, and coordinator of the Argentine branch of the People&amp;rsquo;s Health Movement, played an important role both in the First Assembly of the People&amp;rsquo;s Health Movement in Cuenca, Ecuador in October, 2013 (see our Newsletter 72 &amp;ndash; click here), and in the Congress of General Medicine in Mar de Plata, Argentina in April, 2014. Here are Julio&amp;rsquo;s comments on the need for radical systemic transformation, if we are to have a sustainable future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARE FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous Letters [in Julio’s blog &lt;em&gt;Esperanzas y Alegremia&lt;/em&gt;] we spoke of the Care of our Future Generations. We declared our hope that, within the maelstrom of the paraphernalia of neo-liberalism with its laws of the market and its consumerist morality, the voices of Ancient Knowledge will oblige us to consider the seventh future generation as we make decisions that affect us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidental with this Knowledge, we share the simple and overwhelming academic concept of sustainability given us by the well-known and respected Lester Brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present day society is indeed sustainable when it satisfies its own needs without denying the needs and perspectives of the future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitution of the Nation of Argentina also addresses the question of the care of the future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph of Article 41 of the Constitution adopted in 1994 clearly states that today’s productive activities shall not compromise the needs of future generations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All citizens have the right to a healthy and balanced environment, fit for human development,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one in which today’s productive activities satisfy present needs without compromising those of the future generations;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;today’s generation has the obligation to preserve the environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding its critical importance, a constitutional article has no value whatever if all people that live in this land, wherever they are, and whatever activities they engage in, do not incorporate the spirit of that article into themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article of the Constitution forces us to ask, &lt;em&gt;what indeed are today’s needs, and how shall we move forward so that the activities that satisfy today’s needs do not compromise those of the future generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;english &#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the Victory of Life!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUIDAR LAS GENERACIONES FUTURAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venimos conversando en Cartas anteriores acerca del Cuidado de las Generaciones Futuras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decíamos de la esperanza que nos da, en medio de la parafernalia neoliberal con sus leyes del mercado y su moral consumista, que lleguen las voces de las Sabidurías Ancestrales que nos indican pensar en la séptima generación futura antes de tomar decisiones que puedan afectar el entorno.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coincidente con esas Sabidurías, compartíamos el sencillo y contundente concepto académico de sustentabilidad que nos trae el afamado y respetado Lester Brown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Es sustentable una sociedad cuando satisface sus necesidades sin afectar las perspectivas de las generaciones futuras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Constitución de la Nación Argentina también nos habla del cuidado de las generaciones futuras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;El primer párrafo del artículo 41º de la Constitución sancionada en 1994, expresa con claridad que las actividades productivas no deben comprometer las generaciones futuras:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todos los habitantes gozan del derecho a un ambiente sano, equilibrado, apto para el desarrollo humano y para &lt;strong&gt;que las actividades productivas satisfagan las necesidades presentes sin comprometer las de las generaciones futuras&lt;/strong&gt; y tienen el deber de preservarlo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Con toda la importancia que tiene lo sancionado en la Constitución, de nada vale si no se internaliza en cada persona que habita este suelo, donde quiera que esté y cualquiera que sea su actividad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Este artículo de la Constitución induce a preguntarnos cuáles son realmente las necesidades presentes y cómo proceder para que las acciones que realicemos para satisfacerlas no afecten las generaciones por venir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasta la Victoria de la Vida Siempre!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julio Monsalvo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facilitated by David Werner in February, 2014&lt;/em&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image001.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=clear&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2014 I, David Werner, visited Burkina Faso, West Africa, at the invitation of the Dutch NGO, &lt;em&gt;Light for the World&amp;ndash;the Netherlands.&lt;/em&gt; I was asked to exchange experiences in Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) and to facilitate workshops, using the Child-to-Child approach, to promote &amp;ldquo;educational inclusion.&amp;rdquo; The objective was to explore ways to make schooling more accessible, friendlier, and more helpful to children with disabilities&amp;ndash; while at the same time making public education more relevant and empowering for all children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The majority of people in Burkina Faso live in the rural area, many in traditional round mud huts.&#34; /&gt;

        The majority of people in Burkina Faso live in the rural area, many in traditional round mud huts.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image003.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Burkina Faso is the world&amp;#39;s forth poorest country.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Burkina Faso is the world&amp;#39;s forth poorest country.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light for the World (LFTW) is a large, service-oriented non-government organization, in some ways similar to the German NGO, Cristoffel-Blinden Mission (CBM), with which it used to be affiliated. Like CBM, its original mission was to prevent blindness and restore sight&amp;ndash;or light&amp;ndash;to blind people in poor countries. Also like CBM, in recent years LFTW&amp;rsquo;s mission has expanded. It now embraces the philosophy and goals of &amp;ldquo;Community Based Rehabilitation,&amp;ldquo;with a broad focus on both the physical and the social needs of disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light for the World currently has programs in many countries in Africa and Asia, and one in South America (Bolivia). In Burkina Faso it helps support seven Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) projects in different parts of the country. It cooperates closely with other programs, both non-government and government, in promoting the rights and habilitation of persons with disabilities. It places strong emphasis on the &amp;ldquo;educational inclusion&amp;rdquo; of disabled children, especially those children who are deaf or blind, because very few of these children are admitted to public schools, and those few who are have an extremely difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans for my visit to Burkina Faso had been percolating for several years&amp;ndash; ever since I first met Lenie Hoegen at a workshop I led in India in 2005. At that time Lenie worked for the Liliane Foundation, under whose auspices the Indian workshop was organized. Lenie is now the Director of LFTW in Burkina Faso. Since early in 2013 Lenie and I had been planning the Burkina Workshop and hoped to work closely on its realization. But sadly, Lenie had a heart attack a week before it took place, and missed out.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In planning my visit to Burkina Faso, Lenie had been intrigued by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://healthwrights.org/content/newsletters/NL60.pdf&#34;&gt;newsletter I wrote about a Child-to-Child workshop&lt;/a&gt; I led for the Education Ministry in Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico, in 2007. Lenie wanted me to do something similar in Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Morelia Workshop was designed to address not only the needs for inclusion of disabled children, but also the health-related needs of all children&amp;ndash;and to do so in an empowering, collaborative way. At that time the state of Michoacan had a progressive government committed to &amp;ldquo;educational reform.&amp;rdquo; It wanted to make schooling more relevant and inclusive, especially for children who have been traditionally marginalized, whether by poverty, ethnicity, or disability. Hence one of the goals of that Workshop was to help transform public education from an authoritarian system of social control, to a liberating environment of &amp;ldquo;education for change.&amp;rdquo; To this end, in the workshop we used the &amp;ldquo;liberating,&amp;rdquo; action-oriented methodology of the famed Brazilian educator, Paulo Freire, author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://libcom.org/library/pedagogy-oppressed-paulo-freire&#34;&gt;Pedagogy of the Oppressed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/figcaption&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these change-making concepts in mind for our Child-to-Child Workshop in Burkina Faso, I was encouraged to introduce methods of &amp;ldquo;Discovery Based Learning&amp;rdquo; that would help children think for themselves, analyze their needs, and work together for the health, rights and inclusion of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Burkina Faso this is a tall order&amp;ndash;as I was soon to discover.In this impoverished African country with devastating inequities, to achieve a healthier, more inclusive social order, far-reaching structural change would be needed. Much of the population is increasingly ready for such change. But the power structure is militantly top-down, with social stratification deeply entrenched. Reinforcing this pecking order, schooling (modeled after the French colonial system) is also very top-down. Like schooling wherever the gap between the powerful and the powerless is great, it teaches students not to question but to obediently follow the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;imagebreak&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burkina Faso-formerly Upper Volta-is a landlocked west-African country with 17 million people. It gained its independence from France in 1960. The UN says Burkina Faso is the world&amp;rsquo;s forth poorest country. It&amp;rsquo;s BNP per capita is US$600. With much of that income pocketed by a very wealthy minority, the poor majority struggle to survive on a pittance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=clear&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telling facts about Burkina Faso:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of the population (81%) live in the rural area, through subsistence farming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a short rainy season and long period of drought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over half the people (80% of the disabled) live below the poverty line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over half of young children are undernourished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under-5 mortality rate is &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; live births&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria are major killers, especially of undernourished children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life expectancy is 55.4 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blindness rate is 1.4%, due mainly to cataract, trachoma, and until recently, onchocerciasis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illiteracy is 71%. UNDP says BF has the world&amp;rsquo;s lowest literacy, with girls much lower than boys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=clear&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image009.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=clear&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Health is officially a top priority, public clinics and hospitals still charge too much for poor people to afford. Most people turn first to traditional healers, then go to the mission hospitals (mostly Catholic) or clinics sponsored by foreign NGOs. There are many such clinics, though not nearly enough, especially in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;This vast new public hospital in the desert north of Oagadougou was designed to serve the rural population, but for many, the cost puts these services out of reach.&#34; /&gt;

        This vast new public hospital in the desert north of Oagadougou was designed to serve the rural population, but for many, the cost puts these services out of reach.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Burkina Faso the power structure has operated under a thin veil of election-based democracy, but in fact has been oppressive . The current President, Blaise Compaore, a military captain, took power through a coup in 1987, by overthrowing (with the help of France) the charismatic socialist leader, Thomas Sankara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left width30&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image032.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first President Compaore made some progressive changes and won a degree of popular support. But as time passed he became more tyrannical and corrupt. He, and his family members, and cronies have amassed enormous wealth and live in palatial estates. (We drove by the President&amp;rsquo;s huge rural estate, with his own private zoo and personal army.) Although his popularity has waned, he still holds onto his power. Twice he changed the National Constitution to allow his reelection. And to assure it, has eliminated his competition by disappearances and arrests. He has now been in power for 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next national election will be held next year (2015). The situation, though so far subdued, is tense. To be reelected once more, the President must once again change the Constitution. But this time, with the vast majority disillusioned and eager for change, people I talked with say that he probably won&amp;rsquo;t dare. By the same token, the President has cut back on the disappearances and arrests of his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, Burkina Faso at present is percolating for change. But what sort of change will take place is uncertain. Will it be peaceful or violent? Will a popular government be elected that responds with fairness to the enormous needs of the destitute majority? Or will a new strong-man emerge who re- entrenches an exploitative elite? Will the people unite and stand up for their rights? Or will they submit to the same old domination and oppression they have been schooled to submissively accept?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;education-as-a-two-edged-sword:df434a9761dafb45178a3b2dd6709987&#34;&gt;Education as a two-edged sword&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image034.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of schooling children receive has a lot to do with how they later respond to critical situations and the possibilities for change. Children who have been schooled to submissively obey authority and follow rules, however unkind or unfair, and to compete with their peers rather than to strive together for the common good, are unlikely to mobilize for positive change. But if children are educated in a way that encourages them to think for themselves, to make their own observation and draw their own conclusions, and then work together for the benefit of all, these children when they grow up are much more likely to become agents of positive change. They are more likely to see through the bribes and false promises of the potentates who beguile the naive to vote for them, only to further exploit them when they gain power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence in societies with stark stratification between rich and poor, between the elite and the subjugated, school systems are designed to instill obedience to authority rather than commitment to equality and fundamental human rights. Suchschools are by design exclusive rather than inclusive. They separate the winners from the losers, the strong from the weak, the able from the disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If standard schools are to become truly inclusive for all, far more will be required than simply making sure some teachers learn sign language and others Braille. Rather, it comes down to a question of redefining and redesigning the purpose and the methods of schooling. It is a question not so much of &lt;em&gt;what we teach, but how we teach&lt;/em&gt;. It is a question of not of &lt;em&gt;pushing ideas into the heads of children&lt;/em&gt;, but rather of &lt;em&gt;pulling them out.&lt;/em&gt;  A question of putting less emphasis on competition and more on cooperation, of everyone helping one another, of those who are quicker assisting those who are slower, of everybody finding a way forward together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image040.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of &lt;em&gt;education for change&lt;/em&gt; is the rationale behind the so-call Inclusive Child-to-Child Workshop in Burkina Faso, as I envisioned it. These ideas are not just my own. Variations on the theme have been widely shared by iconoclastic educators the world round, from Rabindranath Tagore to J. Krishnamurti to Paulo Freire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be seen in the presentation of the Workshop to follow, different people at the Workshop responded differently to some of the more iconoclastic learning methods I introduced to promote &amp;ldquo;inclusive education.&amp;rdquo; Some even questioned whether I was trying to kindle a socialist revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, I think a lot of people&amp;ndash;including many of the children involved&amp;ndash;began to think about education and inclusion from a new and challenging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burkina Faso, from the little I have learned about it and observed, is a country with a lot of needs and difficultiess, but in some ways a lot of strengths and potential. Its main strength appears to be in its people: the ordinary farming and working people. They struck me as having an intrinsic warmth, integrity, and sense of community. There was a basic friendliness and welcoming, especially outside the capital city, that made me feel comfortable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image041.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, poverty in Burkina Faso is a big problem, and sometimes disabling or lethal. But with the poverty, like disability, the downside often has sometimes been its upside. In much of the rest of the world, the primary underlying cause of preventable chronic illness and death is over-consumption of sugar-loaded foods and drinks, linked with obesity But in Burkina Faso, most people can&amp;rsquo;t afford the sugary drinks and junk foods that are undermining the health even of (and especially of) the poor. In Burkina Faso, for the most part, only those above poverty level have a tendency to be overweight, and such persons are a relatively small minority. The very poor majority can&amp;rsquo;t afford such indulgence, and many of those I observed (admittedly not in the most remote areas of the country) looked surprisingly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, diseases like malaria and trachoma, as well as childhood diarrhea and pneumonia, still take a high toll. And for many, when people are sick, health services are either out of reach or ruinously expensive. Low wages, inadequate public services, and the stark concentration of wealth and power, unquestionably cause a lot of preventable suffering and death. Many people are ready for change. If schooling can be made more inclusive for those who are marginalized, and more empowering and egalitarian for all, perhaps the people will begin to collectively analyze their needs and join together to bring about the changes that can lead to greater health and inclusion for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;misc-notes:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Misc Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For notes use NOTE-xx:  where xx is initials of person for that note.  use no initial for a generic note.  Could us bold-italics for notes.  Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE-dk:this is example note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to use the note snippet.   type nt then the tab key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to add a picture type img then tab then enter filename and caption in the quotes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-snippets:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;other snippets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;img then tab key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;an-exhibit-of-markdown:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;An exhibit of Markdown&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This note demonstrates some of what &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically save itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-formatting:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Basic formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is an example is Italics - Just put the text in astericks without a leading or following space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use double asterisks for bold and single for italics.  No
Basic formatting of &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; is supported. This &lt;em&gt;can be &lt;strong&gt;nested&lt;/strong&gt; like&lt;/em&gt; so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three asterisks before and after is bold and italics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lists:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ordered-list:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Ordered list&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A second item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fourth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm&#34;&gt;Roman numeral four&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;unordered-list-bullets:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Unordered list - bullets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paragraph-modifiers:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Paragraph modifiers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-block:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Code block&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also make &lt;code&gt;inline code&lt;/code&gt; to add code into other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Quote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;headings:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Headings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;h1-the-heading-was-entered-all-lower-case:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;H1 the heading was entered all lower case&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;h2-the-heading-was-entered-all-lower-case:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;H2 the heading was entered all lower case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;h3-the-heading-was-entered-all-lower-case:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;H3 the heading was entered all lower case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;h4-the-heading-was-entered-all-lower-case:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;H4 the heading was entered all lower case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;headings-can-also-contain-formatting:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Headings &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; also contain &lt;strong&gt;formatting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;they-can-even-contain-inline-code:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;They can even contain &lt;code&gt;inline code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you&amp;rsquo;re smallest heading isn&amp;rsquo;t too small, and you&amp;rsquo;re largest heading isn&amp;rsquo;t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;urls:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;URLs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLs can be made in a handful of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A named link to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markitdown.net/&#34;&gt;MarkItDown&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+L&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another named link to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markitdown.net/&#34;&gt;MarkItDown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you just want a URL like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markitdown.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.markitdown.net/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;horizontal-rule:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Horizontal rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes handy for breaking things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;images:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown can also contain images. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to add something here sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finally:97ac6be63879f184c71e2c43ee0ac641&#34;&gt;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&#34;&gt;syntax&lt;/a&gt; for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first part&lt;/strong&gt; covers my initial days in Burkina Faso, where the Light for the World staff took me to visit some of the activities and projects it supports in the capital city of Ouagadougou and neighboring areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second part&lt;/strong&gt; covers the 4-day Workshop I facilitated in the towns of Temkodogo and Garango. The 4-day Workshop is arranged day by day:
     * Day 1 and Day 2 are days of preparation in which participants        planned, practiced, and prepared to facilitate &amp;ldquo;discovery-based-learning&amp;rdquo; activities for a mixed group of children. The participants&amp;ndash;mostly potential&amp;rdquo;multipliers&amp;rdquo; of the Child-to-Child inclusive education methodology&amp;ndash;included educators, teachers, special education instructors, CBR workers, representatives from the Ministry of Education, and staff from various NGOs.
     * Day 3 is the key Child-to-Child event, realized with a mix of 50 non-disabled and disabled children. In two adjacent classrooms a pair of sessions are facilitated simultaneously by two groups of the adult workshop participants.
     * Day 4 is a day of evaluation, in which everyone involved&amp;ndash;including the children&amp;ndash;take part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;credits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  -  The photographs in this photo-documentary were taken by David Werner, Philippe Compoare, and the LFTW communications staff-person, Clement Bihoun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ouagadougou-center-and-school-for-the-blind:80cb3d00ef0e4c6dfe5b60d1c1eefba9&#34;&gt;The Ouagadougou Center and School for the Blind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image013.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The School for Blind Youth In the capital city of Oagadougou was one of the first programs we visited. It is assisted by Light for the World (LFTW), the Dutch NGO that sponsored my workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image014.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blind children attend this special school for the first six years, and then are mainstreamed into normal schools. However most of the public schools and their teachers are poorly prepared to accommodate the needs of the disabled children. Therefore Light for the World, collaborating with OCADES (Caritas in Burkina Faso) and other organizations, provides special training to teachers. In addition, these organizations attempt to raise awareness in general, since there are still a lot of fears and superstitions regarding people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image015.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blind child greets me and Philippe Compaore, Light for the World&amp;rsquo;s project assistant for inclusive education in Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image016.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting the director of the school for blind children&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image017.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the classrooms with blind children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image018.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image019.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for learning Braille, children arrange small pebbles in patterns on a grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image020.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the children use Braille to study their lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image022.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy machine for reproducing materials in Braille. The program produces learning material in Braille, not only for its own school, but for other schools that are beginning to mainstream blind students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image023.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Child-to-Child comes naturally here. Older blind children often guide and teach younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image024.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children with limited vision are willing guides for those who are totally blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;visits-in-kaya:80cb3d00ef0e4c6dfe5b60d1c1eefba9&#34;&gt;Visits in Kaya&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff from the Light for the World took me to visit the town of Kaya, 200 km northeast of Oagadougou. Kaya is the base for one of the seven Community Based Rehabilitation projects assisted by LFTW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-community-based-rehabilitation-project-in-kaya:80cb3d00ef0e4c6dfe5b60d1c1eefba9&#34;&gt;The Community Based Rehabilitation project in KAYA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image026.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some of the staff and &amp;ldquo;CBR agents&amp;rdquo; of the Kaya Community Based Rehabilitation project pose with Elie Bagbila (on right) and me. Elie is Light for the World&amp;rsquo;s country representative. He has a more personal understanding of people with disabilities because he has a weak leg due to polio as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image027.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kaya CBR team welcomed me warmly. They presented me with a handmade leather briefcase and an artistic map of Africa. They call the French edition of &lt;em&gt;Disabled Village Children&lt;/em&gt; their &amp;ldquo;bible.&amp;rdquo; I was happy to see that all the rehab programs I visited make good use of my book. Light for the World is currently planning to translate the companion book, &lt;em&gt;Nothing About Us Without Us,&lt;/em&gt; into French, partly because it has examples of Child-to-Child activities for inclusion of disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;center-for-deaf-children-in-kaya:80cb3d00ef0e4c6dfe5b60d1c1eefba9&#34;&gt;Center for Deaf Children in Kaya&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image028.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Kaya is remarkable school and training center for deaf children and youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image029.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff of the Kaya CBR center took us to visit this remarkable training center for deaf children, with which LFTW and the CBR program collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image030.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSHA School is &amp;ldquo;inclusive&amp;rdquo; in that it has both deaf and non-deaf pupils: 160 in all. The youngsters appear to enjoy it and get along well.  The Center provides scholarships to the deaf children from poor families. Over half of the children attending the school are deaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image033.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daughter of the CSHA&amp;rsquo;s founder is among the hearing children who attend the school. Because the quality of teaching is much better than in the regular schools, plenty of non-disabled children attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image035.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This teacher, who is deaf, attended the CSHA school as a boy, and now teaches here. He is a great role model for the children, whom he treats with friendly respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image036.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classes are small, with lots of individual attention, whereas in the standard schools classrooms have up to 70 pupils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image037.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSHA teaches the children to use sign language, and tries to mainstream them into regular schools as soon as possible. But most schools and teachers are poorly equipped to include them. Light for the World, which helps sponsor CSHA, is collaborating to train teachers in normal schools to better meet the needs of deaf, blind, and other disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image039.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the deaf children, their hands are their tongues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-morija-orthopedic-center-kaya:80cb3d00ef0e4c6dfe5b60d1c1eefba9&#34;&gt;The Morija Orthopedic Center, Kaya&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This large, high quality rehabilitation and surgical center in Kaya was set up by a Swiss NGO. Although it is run and staffed by local doctors and therapists, a team of orthopedic surgeons and other specialists fly in from Switzerland four to five times a year. Services for the poor are virtually free. Special facilities are provided so that relatives can stay there with their disabled family member for as long as is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image042.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Morija Center provides referral services for the Kaya Community Based Rehabilitation project, as well as the other CBR projects supported by Light for the World and OCADES (Caritas, the Catholic assistance program).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image044.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy room of the Morija Center is well equipped with modern equipment, yet has a friendly, down-to-earth atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image045.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a local physiotherapist teaches a brain-injured man&amp;rsquo;s wife to help with his exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;home-visits-kaya:80cb3d00ef0e4c6dfe5b60d1c1eefba9&#34;&gt;Home visits, Kaya&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBR agents of the project near Kaya took me to visit the homes of two disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image046.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This child has epilepsy and developmental delay. Epilepsy can be a major stigma, since many people believe the person with fits is possessed by evil spirits. Dispelling these beliefs is a big challenge for the CBR agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image047.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Elie Bagbila, the country representative for Light for the World in Burkina Faso, greets a disabled child in the family home, near Kaya. The little boy has cerebral palsy with a lot of spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image048.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This special seat, brought from Holland and made of molded plastic, doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for the spastic boy, who constantly slips forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried positioning the child better and holding him in place with the attached seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image050.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the belt was attached so high that with his spasms the child soon thrusted forward under it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image051.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the child&amp;rsquo;s spastic feet pushed stiffly downward, I found that by bending his knee, his foot could be slowly raised to less than 90 degrees. We suggested that his mother do these exercises regularly, to prevent contractures that could reduce later possibilities for walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image052.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is common in CBR programs in many countries, much more attention tends to be placed on children&amp;rsquo;s social needs than physical needs, and often the assistive equipment provided is unsatisfactory. An example is this girl&amp;rsquo;s oversized wheelchair. Notice the distance between her feet and the footrests! Also, the chair is so wide, it makes it harder for her to push it herself, perpetuating her dependency on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-workshop-meetings:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Pre-Workshop Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff from the Light for the World and I visited officials from the mayor&amp;rsquo;s office, the Ministry of Education, and influential NGOs, as well as the priest of the local Diocese. These meetings were critical because one of our objectives was to promote the inclusion of the disabled in the public schools, as well as to help make schooling more relevant and empowering for ALL children. Our goal was that the methods of awareness raising, inclusion and &amp;ldquo;education for change&amp;rdquo; would not only be adopted by the educators and children in the workshops, but would progressively be &amp;ldquo;scaled up&amp;rdquo; throughout the country, and beyond. For this reason it was thought that gaining the good will and involvement of planners and decision makers was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here representatives of the Ministry of Education pose for a photo with staff of Light for the World and David Werner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippe Compaore, Light for the World&amp;rsquo;s Project Assistant for Inclusive Education in Burkina Faso, discusses the purpose of the workshop with the regional director of the Department of Education. The Director became so interested in the Child-to-Child approach that she attended and participated in our workshop herself. She plans to integrate some of the discovery-based activities, both for health education and inclusion, into the school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image055.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our preliminary visit to the Department of Education we were joined by my interpreter, Sanogo Hamadou (center) and Marieke Boersma, from Holland, who is the international advisor and CBR trainer for Light for the World in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the Workshop focused mainly on different approaches to Community Based Rehabilitation, and how the CBR concept has evolved over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image057.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Marieke, who came all the way from her base in Ethiopia, joins me in the opening session of the workshop in Tenkodogo. Enthusiastic about the workshop, she plans to introduce some of the activities into the programs she councils in other countries, especially in South Sudan where children&amp;rsquo; health and disability needs are exceptionally dire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image058.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interpreter (sitting across from me) did a good job translating my English into French. But with the translation, everything took more than twice as long, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t cover all the themes I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the workshop were persons chosen to become &amp;ldquo;multipliers&amp;rdquo; of the inclusive Child-to-Child methodology. The expectation is that they will introduce the approach in schools and communities, first locally as a pilot program, and then throughout the country. The participants included educators, officials from the Health Ministry, school teachers, special educators, Community Based Rehab personnel, and representatives from various NGOs such as Christoffel BlindenMission, Stichting Liliane Fonds, OCADES (Caritas), and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image060.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first day of the workshop I presented slides of PROJIMO, the village-based rehabilitation program I helped start over 30 years ago in rural Mexico. I emphasized the importance of leadership in such programs by disabled persons themselves. (The CBR programs we visited in Burkina Faso&amp;ndash;like many elsewhere&amp;ndash;have relatively few disabled persons in their ranks. CBR programs need to put higher priority on &amp;ldquo;inclusiveness&amp;rdquo; within their own organizations.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugoshortcode-9:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image061.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image062.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burkina Faso, for all the friendliness and good will of its people, has a very top-down, authoritarian government and highly inequitable distribution of wealth and power, which goes a long ways toward explaining the hardships, hunger and handicaps of a vast number of its people. Early in the workshop therefore, I felt it was important to stress the need to prepare young people to become &amp;ldquo;agents of change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pointed out that in Latin America, Child-to-Child activities are often facilitated using the empowering, discovery-based methodology of the iconoclastic Brazilian educator, Paulo Freire, author of &amp;ldquo;Pedagogy of the Oppressed.&amp;rdquo; Freire compared conventional education&amp;ndash;which is in large part obedience training designed to perpetuate the inequities of the status quo&amp;ndash; with &amp;ldquo;liberating education&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;education for change.&amp;rdquo; Likewise in health education, typically, those in positions of authority try to &amp;ldquo;change the behavior&amp;rdquo; of the poor and marginalized. But in Freire&amp;rsquo;s liberating approach, the poor and downtrodden try to change the behavior of the ruling class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image064.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To symbolize this bottom-up approach, after showing the above slide I showed a drawing of a group of poor farmers and laborers confronting a surprised group of doctors, businessmen, scientists, and politicians, collectively declaring &amp;ldquo;WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE YOU!&amp;rdquo; On seeing this slide, some of the professionals and officials in the workshop got quite upset, and asked me if I was try start a revolution.

&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image063.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image065.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other participants, however, were far more receptive. They noted how the entrenched inequalities in Burkina Faso contribute to marginalization and disability. In the course of the hands-on workshop, even many of the professionals and authorities came around to appreciating the importance of discovery-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;helping-schoolchildren-learn-about-common-health-problems-in-a-hands-on-inclusive-way:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Helping schoolchildren learn about common health problems - in a hands-on, inclusive way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In planning the Inclusive Child-to-Child Workshop in Burkina Faso, the staff of Light for the World had decided to include activities that could help schoolchildren learn about some of the most common and serious health problems. Special emphasis was given to the needs of infants and preschool children where the incidence of preventable disability and death is especially high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;early home management of diarrhea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are of central importance with regard to protecting infant health, reducing the high child death rate, and preventing disability, it was decided that it would be appropriate in the Workshop to include activities to help schoolchildren learn about these two urgent interrelated health needs. Through hands-on &amp;ldquo;learning by doing&amp;rdquo; the children, the children could begin to take simple measures to protect the health of their baby brothers and sisters in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, every effort would be made to introduce and adapt these activities in ways that would make them as fully inclusive as possible for children with a range of disabilities … and to do by engaging all the children in looking for ways to welcome and involve those with a disability,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;discovery-based-learning-about-diarrhea-and-dehydration-with-the-gourd-baby-as-the-teacher:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Discovery based Learning about Diarrhea and Dehydration, with the Gourd Baby as the teacher&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image066.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A splendid example of discovery based learning is use of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gourd Baby.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image068.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippe showed the participants the Gourd Baby, while I presented slides of how children experiment with it to discover the signs of &amp;ldquo;too much water loss&amp;rdquo; (dehydration), and how to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their own experiments and observations with the Gourd Baby, children discover the danger signs of dehydration when a baby brother or sister has diarrhea. They also learn how to prepare a &amp;ldquo;special drink,&amp;rdquo; which, if they give enough of it in time to a baby brother or sister, can combat dehydration and even save the child&amp;rsquo;s life. For children to have these skills related to the home management of diarrhea is of critical importance in families when both parents are away working, and only school-aged children are left at home as the sole caretakers. Indeed, the idea of &amp;ldquo;Child-to-Child&amp;rdquo; grew out of the recognition that in poor families, school-aged children (especially the girls) often spend more time with their baby brothers and sisters than do their working mothers or fathers. If they can learn some basics about how to promote the health and development of the infants they care for, they not only help their siblings, but they learn skills that can come in very handy when they have children of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;an-example-of-participatory-epidemiology-conducted-by-schoolchildren-the-child-to-child-nutrition-activity:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;An example of &amp;ldquo;Participatory Epidemiology&amp;rdquo; conducted by schoolchildren: The Child-to-Child Nutrition Activity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another activity presented in the Workshop was about &lt;em&gt;Nutrition.&lt;/em&gt; Here schoolchildren in a Child-to-Child workshop in Michoacan, Mexico, measure the upper arms of cardboard babies. They did this as practice for a survey they planned to make of &amp;ldquo;children-under-five&amp;rdquo; in their community, to identify which youngsters are &amp;ldquo;too thin.&amp;rdquo; After completing their survey, the pupils took action to help the &amp;ldquo;too-thin&amp;rdquo;children gain weight. They leared to do a variety of simple things, like making sure weaning gruels are made thick enough to be calorie rich, adding a bit of vegetable oil to the baby&amp;rsquo;s food, and giving food to the &amp;ldquo;too thin&amp;rdquo; toddlers more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image069.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slide from Mexico shows a blind child measuring the arm circumference of a cardboard baby, using a sting with knots in it, rather than a measuring tape, so the blind boy can measure by feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image070.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Day 2 of the workshop, participants had a chance to practice the activities that they chose to facilitate with the group of non-disabled and disabled children the following day. One of these activities was the Child-to-Child activity on Diarrhea, in which the children will experiment with the Gourd Baby to discover the signs of dangerous water loss (dehydration), and learn what action they can take to protect their baby brothers and sisters when they get diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image072.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I brought this Gourd Baby from Mexico (it has traveled to more than a dozen countries), similar gourds can be found in Burkina Faso. But where an appropriate gourd is unavailable, a plastic bottle can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was necessary to practice the methodologies that the workshop participants planned to facilitate with the children the next day. The challenge will be to help the children discover the signs of dehydration without being told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the participants fill the Gourd Baby with water, then pull the plug in the backside, and ask everyone to observe what happens. The first thing they observe is that the soft spot or fontanel (a cloth covering the hole in the top of the head) sinks in. &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; asks the facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because the water is running out!&amp;rdquo; the group answers. In a similar way, they discover the other signs of dehydration. Since the Gourd Baby has all the same holes that a normal baby has, participants can pull the plugs to learn the different signs of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No less important&amp;ndash;as one needs to keep re-emphasizing&amp;ndash;the Gourd Baby is also an excellent tool to introduce the art of Discovery Based Learning, whereby the teacher pulls ideas out of the children rather than pushing them in. However, this requires a big shift in teaching methods for teachers long used to a didactic, top-down style of teaching. Discovery based learning can be very challenging. It requires a lot of rethinking&amp;ndash;and a lot of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image074.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An official from the regional Ministry of Education was enthralled with the discovery-based learning, and here takes photos of the process in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image077.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one sign of dehydration that cannot be taught with the Gourd Baby is the &amp;ldquo;skin-fold test.&amp;rdquo; To learn this, a sock with a small ball in it is stretched over the hand to represent a baby. The sock has a hole over the wrist. Someone is asked to pinch and pull the skin on the baby&amp;rsquo;s chest. With the wrist bent forward when the skin is pinched, the skin fold will remains obvious after letting it go (a sign of dehydration). But if the wrist is bent forward when pinched, the skin fold will disappear at once (no dehydration). In this workshop we used my wrist because the skin folds are more prominent on a skinny old man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image078.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next came the nutrition activity, where participants practiced measuring the upper arms of cardboard babies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure the baby&amp;rsquo;s arms, they made 3-colored measuring strips. And to enable blind children to measure by feel, they made &amp;ldquo;measuring strings&amp;rdquo; with knots in right places (at 12.5 and 13.5 cm,).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image081.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making the measuring strips, they practiced measuring the arms of the cardboard babies. To include this deaf participant, the sign language interpreter translated the instructions for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image082.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the deaf participant measures the arm of a cardboard baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image083.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After practicing a selection of activities, the participants divided into two groups. The next day each group would facilitate a separate workshop with a group of children, some of them disabled. Now was the time for them to decide upon, plan and organized agenda for the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this process of &amp;ldquo;learning by doing&amp;rdquo; for some of the participants proved quite a challenge, especially for those in the first group, shown above. Many of the teachers and the officials in the Education Ministry, having themselves been schooled in a top-down, authoritarian system, felt more comfortable being told what to do than being asked to figure things out for themselves. But eventually they came up with their own plan of activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image084.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image085.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first group decided to focus on Child-to-Child activates related to seeing and hearing. In these activities, older children learn to test the vision and hearing of younger children who are first entering school. Also they try to figure out ways to help the youngsters with visual or auditory handicaps to be more fully included in the classroom and to learn with the help of others. This group also planned awareness-raising role-plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image087.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2nd group chose to focus on the Diarrhea Activity with the Gourd Baby. In addition they chose the Nutrition Activity, to help schoolchildren identify infants who are &amp;ldquo;too thin&amp;rdquo; and then take action to try to improve their food intake. This group divided into 2 sub-groups to plan and coordinate these two activities, one on Nutrition, and one on Diarrhea. The sub-group on Nutrition decided they needed to make more cardboard babies, with a wide variety of arm thickness, so the children could simulate conducting a community survey, and learn how to tabulate their results. Their hope was that after the workshop the children would conduct a real survey of real babies in their community, and then do what they could to help those who are &amp;ldquo;too thin&amp;rdquo; gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image089.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping in the planning and preparations of the 2nd group was a Peace Corps volunteer named Emily, whose fluency in both English and French was a big help (especially to me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3-the-two-child-to-child-workshops-in-garango:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Day 3: The two Child-to-Child workshops in Garango&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image090.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the big day of the workshops with the children, the official from the Department of Education helped organize the event. It was held at a primary school in Garango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 120 people taking part in the two Child-to-Child workshops&amp;ndash; including 50 children, 16 of them disabled&amp;ndash;things were a bit chaotic getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A member of the sub-group in charge of the nutrition activity arrived with an armful of cardboard babies they&amp;rsquo;d made the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image093.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the confusion, the action started more than an hour late. But the children were surprisingly patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image094.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 50 children selected to participate in the workshops, the school yard was replete with other curious youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image096.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image097.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 disabled children, 4 were blind, 5 deaf, 5 physically disabled, 1 intellectually disabled, and one was a short person with impaired legs, shown here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most of the children in the workshops, including the disabled ones, were in the 6th grade of primary school, their ages varied greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently in Burkina Faso there are few new cases of polio, thanks to vaccination. Yet there are still many older children, like this 16-year-old, who must cope with the residual paralysis caused by polio in their early years. A lot of the assistive equipment in Burkina Faso is provided by foreign NGOs. However, many aids, such as the hand-powered tricycle on which this boy came, are made locally, some by disabled crafts persons. Also, his leg braces were made by a local technician, himself disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image100.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two simultaneous workshops were held in adjacent classrooms. The children sat on one side of the classroom, the facilitators-in-training on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ice-breaking-activity:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Ice-breaking activity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an &amp;ldquo;icebreaker,&amp;rdquo; the night before one group of facilitators had prepared drawings on pieces of cardboard. These they cut in half and randomly handed them out to the children. Then the each child was asked to look for his or her &amp;ldquo;other half.&amp;rdquo; After finding each other, they would spend a few minutes getting to know each other. Finally they would take turns introducing their new friend to the plenary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image101.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to include the blind children in the ice-breaker, the pieces of cardboard were cut into different shapes and then cut in half, so a blind child could look for his &amp;ldquo;other half&amp;rdquo; by touch rather than visually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image102.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This boy must look for the other half of his cardboard fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image103.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blind boy was first shown the two halves of the fish and how to fit them together by feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image104.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image105.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blind girl with half a chicken needs to find her &amp;ldquo;other half.&amp;rdquo;
And after some hunting, at last the two halves meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;community-diagnosis-through-drawings:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Community diagnosis through drawings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image106.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image107.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a &amp;ldquo;community diagnosis,&amp;rdquo; activity, sheets of paper were handed out. Each child asked to draw a &amp;ldquo;common problem that affects health and well-being&amp;rdquo; in their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a wider spectrum of health-related problems, the children were asked to draw a problem different from that of the child sitting on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image108.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children took the project seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image110.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy on crutches drew this picture of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image111.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However one child wasn&amp;rsquo;t participating! Unfortunately, when the drawing paper was handed out, no one noticed that this girl in a wheelchair had nothing firm to support her sheet of paper. Even though the purpose of the workshop was to sensitization to disabled children&amp;rsquo;s needs, at first everybody overlooked this very obvious one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image112.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, after some prompting, this deaf girl saw the problem and with the help of the sign-language interpreter, pointed it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image113.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This boy resolved the difficulty by placing a stiff folder under the girl&amp;rsquo;s paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image114.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even so, the girl was too nervous and afraid to start drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image115.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the boy gently helped her get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image116.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the friendly atmosphere, the girl began to relax. And soon she was drawing by herself. By the end of the workshop she had made new friends and participated eagerly. She looked much happier and self-assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image118.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the other children were drawing, this blind girl recorded in Braille the problem she had selected. The other children marveled at the blind girl&amp;rsquo;s ability to write and read by touching with her fingers a pattern of tiny raised dots. This helped them appreciate her strengths rather than just see her weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image119.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eagerness of the children and their openness to the new perspectives of inclusion were inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-activity-on-diarrhea-with-the-gourd-baby:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;The activity on &lt;em&gt;diarrhea&lt;/em&gt; with the Gourd Baby&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image120.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image121.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning the activity on Management of Diarrhea, one of the teachers introduces the Gourd Baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the children volunteered to conduct the experiment with the Gourd Baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image122.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image123.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First they filled the gourd with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they began to experiment to discover the different signs of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image125.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be inclusive, the facilitators had one of the blind children feel the Gourd Baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image127.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it was the adults who took the initiative to include the blind children.But with a few reminders, the grown-ups let the schoolchildren themselves take responsibility for making sure the disabled children were included. The children caught on quickly, and eagerly took turns in this inclusive process. The blind children were delighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image128.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They made sure each blind child had a chance to feel the different features of the Gourd Baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;! [](image130.jpg&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo; %}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After covering the hole in the top of the gourd with a cloth to form the &amp;ldquo;soft spot&amp;rdquo; the children let the blind youngsters touch the soft spot again, and feel how sinks in when the water runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image131.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the children discover how the stream of pee slows down and then stops when as the Gourd Baby looses liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image133.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastically, through the own observations, the children discovered the different signs of dehydration and wrote them on the blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image135.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out if dehydration can be dangerous, the children compare a leafy plant left in water, and one left without water. When asked, &amp;ldquo;What they think happens to a baby without enough water?&amp;rdquo; they conclude, &amp;ldquo;Maybe it too shrivels up and dies!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image137.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make sure the blind children have a chance to feel the plants, with water&amp;hellip; and without&amp;hellip;so they can draw their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image138.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the workshop, this blind girl looked unhappy and withdrawn. But with all the attention and interaction, she began to smile, speak out, and get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image140.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discovering the signs and dangers of dehydration, the children learned to make a &amp;ldquo;special drink&amp;rdquo; to prevent and combat it. With a home-made measuring spoon, they measured the right amounts of sugar and salt in a glass of water. To be certain the Special Drink they&amp;rsquo;d made was safe, they asked the blind girl to taste it, and make sure it was &amp;ldquo;no saltier than tears.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-perspectives-on-inclusion-and-exclusion:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;New perspectives on &amp;ldquo;inclusion and exclusion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image141.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the children in the workshop were engaged in all these discovery-based activities, a crowd of village children peered in through the windows, wide- eyed with curiosity.I thought this &amp;ldquo;window watching&amp;rdquo; audience was a great way to spread the new ideas to more children. Unfortunately one of the teachers in our workshop angrily tried to run the window-watching local children away. This led to an eye-opening discussion about the importance of an &amp;ldquo;open door policy&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;inclusive education&amp;rdquo;, and the value of letting &amp;ldquo;outsiders&amp;rdquo; observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-nutrition-activity:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;The Nutrition Activity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nutrition Activity began by teachers asking the children if they think it is dangerous for a baby to be &amp;ldquo;too thin&amp;rdquo; - and how they can find out which babies might be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image146.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the Nutrition Activity, facilitators in that group had made a batch of cardboard babies for the children in the workshop to practice measuring which babies were &amp;ldquo;too thin.&amp;rdquo; The goal was that afterwards, with the help of their teachers, they could conduct their own survey of &amp;ldquo;under-fives&amp;rdquo; in their village, and look for solutions to help those who are &amp;ldquo;too thin&amp;rdquo; put on weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image147.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give realistic measurements to the arms of the cardboard babies, the facilitators taped padding on the back of the babies&amp;rsquo; forearms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image148.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
  &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-

&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image149.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the children in this activity carefully make their arm-measuring strips. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; They measured and colored the strips into three zone, to indicate which infants and toddlers are &amp;ldquo;too thin,&amp;rdquo; (red), &amp;ldquo;marginal&amp;rdquo; (yellow), and &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; (green). The yellow &amp;ldquo;marginal&amp;rdquo; band falls between 12.5 and 13.5 cm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image150.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a boy helps a blind girl make a &amp;ldquo;measuring string&amp;rdquo; with the same 3 zones marked by knots, so she can measure arm circumference by feeling the knots. This is a good example of the way the children learn to work together and look for ways to adapt to each child&amp;rsquo;s special needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image152.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image153.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the children begin to measure the cardboard babies and record their findings. This plump baby measures in the green. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; And this skinny baby measures in the red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image155.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After measuring all the babies, the children use match boxes to make a 3-dimensional graph of their &amp;ldquo;survey&amp;rdquo; findings. They color the ends of match boxes&amp;ndash;red, yellow, or green&amp;ndash;according to their findings for each baby. The baby that this boy measured was &amp;ldquo;too thin.&amp;rdquo; His match box is red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image156.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By stacking the matchboxes in 3 columns, the children create their &amp;ldquo;graph&amp;rdquo; showing the nutritional status of the babies they measured. Later, with the help of their teachers, they can conduct a real survey of the under-five babies in their communities. Then they make an effort to see that the &amp;ldquo;too thin&amp;rdquo; babies get high-calorie snacks and eat more often. Then they can repeat their study to see if fewer are too thin. In this way, schoolchildren can make a real contribution to child health in their communities.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;identifying-and-helping-children-who-don-t-see-well:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Identifying and helping children who don&amp;rsquo;t see well&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image158.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this activity the children learn to test one another&amp;rsquo;s vision. Later, at school, these 6th graders can test the vision (and hearing) of 1st graders who are just entering school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they identify a child who can&amp;rsquo;t hear or see well, the children can think of simple ways to make sure that child is not left out, like having her sit up front where she can see the blackboard or hear the teacher better. Or perhaps a friendly child can sit next to the one who can&amp;rsquo;t see or hear well, and make sure she understands. It is important that these ideas for inclusion come from the group of children, challenging their creativity and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image161.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this visual testing, the children made sure to fully involve those with disabilities. Here the girl with short stature tests the vision of a deaf boy.I loaned her my walking stick to point to the letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-role-play-about-inclusion-in-the-classroom:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;A role-play about inclusion in the classroom&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image163.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This improvised role play, performed by both the adults and children in the workshop, portrays a teacher who makes no effort to include a child who is blind, until the other pupils, led by a child who is physically disabled, insist she make a greater effort to include the blind child, and treat him with respect. For the benefit of deaf persons present&amp;ndash;including the deaf boy who acted the blind one&amp;ndash;the sign-language interpreter translated everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image165.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On leaving the Workshop for a break, two of the blind children stick together: Disabled-Child-to-Disabled-Child. Also the blind girl and her &amp;ldquo;other half&amp;rdquo; from the icebreaker game have maintained their friendship, and the sighted boy in the green shirt helps guide his blind companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image166.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image167.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it is the village children outside the workshop who practice Child- to-Child in their day to day lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;an-awareness-raising-game-the-importance-of-being-able-to-see-and-hear-well:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;An awareness raising game: The importance of being able to SEE and HEAR well&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image168.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image169.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game a blindfolded child stands in a small circle of stones&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and the children take turns trying to sneak up and steal a stone without being heard. If the blindfolded child hears the robber, she points at him, and he&amp;rsquo;s out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image171.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy on crutches at first did not join this game. He sat under a tree. But then the other children invited him to join. Everyone was amazed how silently the boy could move on his crutches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image172.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blindfolded girl, although her hearing is normal, was unable to hear most of the children as they sneaked up to steal the stones …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugoshortcode-85:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image173.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image174.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… Then they asked a blind girl to stand in the circle of stones. Her hearing proved to be much sharper than the children who could see. Almost no one could steal a stone. Everyone was amazed at the blind girl&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary hearing. It helped them focus on her ability, not her disability. They saw how a person who is weak in one area can become outstandingly skilled in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Jim &amp;ndash; consider using the other pic of this blind girl, showing her pointing &amp;ndash; to make the point in the cap. Agreed that the pic you chose is the better pic. Alternatively, in this case you just might include both pics if this girl, It&amp;rsquo;s your call.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;simulation-games-with-a-pretend-disability:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;Simulation games with a pretend disability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help non-disabled children better understand those with disability, they played simulation games. Here a young athlete has one leg tied up so he has to hop along using a crutch. Then the young athlete and the boy on crutches ran a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image177.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was a tie! Now the young athlete has greater appreciation for the disabled boy&amp;rsquo;s ability . And so does everyone else! All the children applauded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Workshop everyone&amp;ndash;young and old, disabled and non-disabled &amp;ndash;joined together with a new sense of solidarity&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evaluation the next day involved all those present in the Workshops, both children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image181.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My translator had been a great help to me throughout the Workshop&amp;ndash;although my own language handicap had slowed things down a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image184.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off the evaluation, small groups were formed to discuss the strengths and weakness of the workshops and to write a summary on poster paper. The disabled children here formed their own group. And the sign language interpreter, as he had done throughout the Workshops, translated for those who were deaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image188.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each group discussed what they had learned in the Workshop, and how they might put it to use afterwards, and they carefully wrote down their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image189.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They liked the fact that they were included in the evaluation, and that their ideas were considered important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image190.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adults split up into the same two groups that had facilitated the simultaneous workshops with the children, to discuss what they&amp;rsquo;d learned and how things might be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image191.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
  &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-

&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image192.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the group of adults who led the Gourd Baby and Nutrition activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the group that facilitated the activities on hearing and seeing. The Catholic priest who coordinated the discussion is a leader of the local Diocese that promotes inclusive education and Community Based Rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image194.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the closing plenary, each of the small groups presented their posters and summarized their observations, welcoming discussion by the entire assembly. (Unfortunately time ran out and the final discussion was cut short.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First to present were the disabled children. Overall they were very happy with the workshop, and the fact that their participation and concerns had been so central to it. They pointed out that, with their disabilities, many had at first been nervous about the workshop. They had feared they would be pitied or made fun of. But by the end of the workshop they felt at ease and respected by the other children, and they had made a lot of friends. They enjoyed the chance to show off their skills, like better hearing, or Braille. All the groups of children spoke up with confidence and had important observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many took an active part in presenting their ideas, showing that they had captured the spirit of inclusion. All said they enjoyed doing things with the disabled children, learning to appreciate their abilities and becoming their friends. While the children&amp;rsquo;s groups enjoyed all the Child-to-Child activities and felt they learned a lot, what topped their list was the Gourd Baby. They liked experimenting with it to learn from their own observations. Their enjoyment was enhanced by including the blind children in each stage of the process. We were all impressed by the careful and caring way the children expressed themselves, and by their eagerness to put what they had learned into practice in their school and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image200.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 3 children&amp;rsquo;s groups presented their evaluations, the two adult groups followed. For the most part they felt very positive about the workshop. They said they&amp;rsquo;d learned a lot, not only about ways to make schooling more inclusive for children who are different, but also about ways to make it more relevant and empowering for ALL children. They liked the methodology of discovery based learning, and of encouraging the children to work together to solve common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the adults felt that planning of the workshop had not been sufficiently directive. They hadn&amp;rsquo;t been given precise enough instructions about just what they were supposed to do, and how. But others of the adults disagreed. They declared that discovery based learning was not just for the children but also for themselves. This set off a debate about obedience training versus education for change. It struck me that the children were much more open to discovery based learning than were some of the grown-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image202.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was disagreement on some issues. But everyone agreed that the inclusion of the disabled children in the Workshop&amp;ndash;and the participation of all the children in the evaluation&amp;ndash;was important to achieving the goals of the Workshop. Likewise there was general agreement that giving an empowering voice to the children by letting them think for themselves and seek solutions collectively may in the long run have great socio-political importance. Such educational practices could give rise to a new generation of &amp;ldquo;agents of change&amp;rdquo; who will help transform Burkina Faso&amp;ndash;and the world&amp;ndash;into a fairer, more inclusive and more equitable environment, where people of all classes and backgrounds can work together for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image204.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows how far this larger vision behind the Workshop may spread? Clearly, the real &amp;ldquo;evaluation&amp;rdquo; will depend on what happens afterwards. The adult participants were chosen as potential &amp;ldquo;multipliers&amp;rdquo; who can take the ideas for inclusive &amp;ldquo;education for change&amp;rsquo; into the classroom and community. Perhaps some of the methods will be put into the school curriculum. Already several children and teachers are talking about introducing into their classrooms or communities some of the activities and methods they learned. Some, for example, were interested in organizing 6th graders to test the vision and hearing of the children just entering school, so they can befriend and assist those who can&amp;rsquo;t see or hear very well. Other teachers and children talked about doing a community survey, measuring the arms of babies in order to better the chances of those who are &amp;ldquo;too thin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image205.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best measure for an evaluation is the &amp;ldquo;SMILE FACTOR.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-gourd-baby:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;The Gourd Baby&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scaling up DISCOVERY BASED LEARNING and the role of CHILDREN AS JUNIOR HEALTH WORKERRS and BUDDING AGENTS OF CHANGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://healthwrights.s3.amazonaws.com/HW-Data/Pictures/Burkina-Faso-March-2014/NL73/w800q80/image207.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The undisputed star of the Workshops in Burkina Faso&amp;ndash;as in workshops in many countries&amp;ndash;was the Gourd Baby. This hands-on teaching aid had a big impact in the workshop, and promises to continue to do so in the future. Already the Light for the World team has recruited local artisans make two such babies out of local gourds. One of these has already traveled to Ethiopia. There it will be used by Marieke (LFTW&amp;rsquo;s regional trainer for CBR and Inclusive Education) to teach children (and mothers) about the management of infant diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enough children begin to think for themselves and work together for the common good, perhaps humanity still has a small chance of learning to live in harmony with one another and in sustainable balance with the world of nature on which our survival depends. It&amp;rsquo;s worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-end:4a0da54f57b2dcaca1b7bb298faca5ed&#34;&gt;THE END &amp;hellip;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hopefully a drop in the bucket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;toward a &lt;strong&gt;NEW BEGINNING.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
