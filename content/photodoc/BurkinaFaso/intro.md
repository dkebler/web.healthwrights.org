The **first part** covers my initial days in Burkina Faso, where the Light for the World staff took me to visit some of the activities and projects it supports in the capital city of Ouagadougou and neighboring areas. 

**The second part** covers the 4-day Workshop I facilitated in the towns of Temkodogo and Garango. The 4-day Workshop is arranged day by day:
     * Day 1 and Day 2 are days of preparation in which participants        planned, practiced, and prepared to facilitate "discovery-based-learning" activities for a mixed group of children. The participants--mostly potential"multipliers" of the Child-to-Child inclusive education methodology--included educators, teachers, special education instructors, CBR workers, representatives from the Ministry of Education, and staff from various NGOs. 
     * Day 3 is the key Child-to-Child event, realized with a mix of 50 non-disabled and disabled children. In two adjacent classrooms a pair of sessions are facilitated simultaneously by two groups of the adult workshop participants.
     * Day 4 is a day of evaluation, in which everyone involved--including the children--take part.
